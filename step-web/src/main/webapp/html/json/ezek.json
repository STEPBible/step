"ESV_summary" : "Ezekiel, a prophet and priest, was exiled to Babylon in 597 BC His ministry extended over at least twenty-three years. The book opens with his first dramatic vision of the \"likeness\" of the Lord himself. Ezekiel was keenly aware of God’s presence and power in human affairs. He addressed both the exiles and the people left in Judah with messages of warning and judgment, predicting the fall of Jerusalem. After Jerusalem’s fall (in 586), Ezekiel prophesied hope and reassurance for the people of Judah, who had then lost the focus of God’s covenant, the temple in Jerusalem. His vision of the valley of dry bones (ch. 37) is a classic picture of God’s ability to renew his people.",
"ESV_introduction" : "Ezekiel was carried into exile in Babylon, where he received his call and exercised his prophetic ministry. His dual role of prophet-priest and his position as \"watchman\" over his people make Ezekiel unique among the prophets and may account for the uniqueness of his message and his methods of delivery. The book contains 48 chapters, divided at the halfway point by the fall of Jerusalem. Ezekiel’s prophecies before this event are chiefly messages of condemnation upon Judah for her sin; following the city’s fall, the prophet speaks to helpless people of the hope and certainty of restoration to their homeland and of worship again in the Temple.",

"chapter_1_overview" : "I saw visions of God. Out of a storm came four creatures. I saw wheels within wheels. Above them was a throne and the figure of a man.",
"chapter_1_summary" : "When the priest Ezekiel, son of Buzi, was 30 years old and near the Kebar River, corresponding with fifth year of Jehoiachin's exile, he saw the heavens opened and saw visions of God. He saw a burning windstorm from the north, with glowing metal in the center of the fire which was surrounded by four humanoid creatures. Each creature had four faces and four wings. They had four hands like men but had feet like bronze cows. Each had the face of a man, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle. Each had two wings spread upward, touching each adjacent creature, and two wings covering their bodies. They followed the spirit without turning as they went. They were illuminated as if on fire and moved quickly like lightening. Beside each creature was a sparkling crystal wheel on the ground. Each of the four wheels had a wheel intersecting them so that they could go in any direction without turning. The wheels were large with rims full of eyes. The wheels moved any way that the creatures did because the creatures spirits were in the wheels. Above the creatures was a ceiling like sparking ice. When the creatures moved, their wings were very loud. A voice came from a Man seated on a sapphire throne above the ceiling. The Man looked like He was on fire from the waste down, and was radiating rainbow light all around Him. This was the likeness of God, so Ezekiel fell facedown and listened.",

"chapter_2_summary" : "God calls Ezekiel \"son of man\" and tells him to stand up while God speaks to him. The Spirit came into Ezekiel and made him stand up. God tells Ezekiel to be a prophet to the Israelites, to speak God's words whether or not the rebellious Israelites listen, and to not be afraid of them. God tells \"son of man\" to not rebel like the Israelites, and to eat what God gives him. God then gave Ezekiel a scroll with words of lament, mourning, and woe on both sides.",

"chapter_3_overview" : "He said to me: \"Israel will not listen.\" I came to the exiles. The LORD said: \"I have made you a watchman. I will open your mouth.\"",
"chapter_3_summary" : "God tells Ezekiel to eat the scroll and then go speak to the Israelites. Ezekiel eats the scroll and it tastes as sweet as honey. God tells Ezekiel (a.k.a. \"son of man\") to speak God's words to the Israelites. God tells him that if he went to foreign nations, they would listen to him, but the Israelites will not listen to God's words because they are obstinate. So God will make Ezekiel just as hardened as they are, so he should not be afraid of them. The Spirit lifted Ezekiel while the four creatures made lots of noise with their wings, and God's hand sent Ezekiel to Tel Abib, where he sat for seven days overwhelmed. God tells Ezekiel that he is now the watchman for the Israelites. If Ezekiel does not speak out about a man's sin to which God alerts Ezekiel, then the man will die for his sin and Ezekiel will be held accountable for his blood. However, if Ezekiel does speak out, then Ezekiel is safe regardless of the man's actions. God tells Ezekiel to go out to the plain where He will speak to him. Ezekiel does go, and finds God standing there, so he falls facedown. The Spirit came into Ezekiel and made him stand up. God tells Ezekiel to go back to his house; where the Israelites will tie him up and God will prevent him from speaking for a while. Then God will tell him what to say and he will then be able to speak God's words to whoever will listen.",

Then he is to lie on his left side for 390 days, bearing the sin of the house of Israel one day for each year that they have sinned. Next he is to lie on his right side for 40 days, bearing the sin of the house of Judah one day for each year they have sinned. God will prevent him from turning until the time is up. While laying on his side for the 390 days, God says Ezekiel should drink water at certain times and eat bread at certain times made of wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, which is to be baked over burning human feces to symbolize how the Israelites will eat defiled food in their exile. Ezekiel protests, saying that he has never defiled himself with unclean food. God allows Ezekiel to bake the bread using cow manure instead. God says that Jerusalem's food supply will be cut off, forcing them to ration food and waste away.",

Then when his symbolic siege is over, he is to burn a third of the hair plus a few strands in the symbolic city, strike a third of the hair around the city with his sword, scatter a third to the wind (because God will pursue them with a sword), and save just a few hairs in the folds of his garment. God says that Jerusalem is more wicked than the nations around it because they have rebelled against God's laws. Because of this God will punish them, doing what He has never done and will never do again. God will make fathers eat their children and will scatter the survivors because they have defiled the sanctuary with pagan idols and practices. A third will die by plague or famine, a third will die by the sword, and a third will be scattered. Then God will be avenged and His wrath will subside. Then they will know God has spoken.

God says that He will spare some Israelites and scatter them among different nations, and they will remember their rebellion and repent, and know that God did not make an empty threat. God tells Ezekiel to clap his hands, stomp his feet, and proclaim that God will punish the Israelites wherever they are, with sword, famine, or plague, so that they will know that God is God.

They will die by sword, plague, and famine. Those who survive will be shamed and scattered. Foreigners will pillage Jerusalem and the Temple.

There, God shows Ezekiel a series of visions of the sins of the Israelites in Jerusalem which ranged from bad to worse. God shows Ezekiel an idol at the north outer gate of the Temple, 70 elders plus Jaazaniah son of Shaphan worshiping idols of unclean animals in the court, women morning the death of the god Tammuz at the north outer gate of the Temple, and about 25 men at the entrance to the Temple worshiping the sun.

God tells the man in linen to retrieve fiery coals from under the cherubim and to spread them on Jerusalem. God went to threshold of the Temple. The man went into the Temple and got coals from one of the cherubim. God then goes above the cherubim, and God and the cherubim left the Temple and went to the east outer gate of the Temple.",

God tells Ezekiel to prophesy against them, so Ezekiel relays God's words. God says that He will bring the sword against Jerusalem and execute judgement on them because they have not kept God's laws, and have conformed to the nations around them. Pelataiah died while Ezekiel prophesied. Ezekiel asks God if He will eliminate the Israelites completely. God replies that although He scattered them among nations, He will gather them back and will give Israel back to them. God will give them a pure heart and a new spirit so that they will obey His laws. They will be God's people, and He will be their God.

Therefore, God will unleash his wrath on them, kill them all, and expose their lies. God tells Ezekiel to prophesy against the female mystics who prophesy lies to the Israelites to make a living.

So in an attempt to regain their hearts, God says to tell them to repent, and leave their idols and sinful practices. If anyone in Israel worships idols and then asks a prophet about God, God will kill him to make an example of him. If the prophet speaks a prophesy which God entices him to do, then God will kill that prophet too. Then the Israelites will no longer stray from God, and He will be their God. God tells Ezekiel that when God punishes a country's sins with famine, if Noah, Daniel, or Job lived there they could only spare themselves through their righteousness. The same would be the case for wild animal attacks, army invasions, and plagues. Such will be the case with Israel when all four of those judgements are applied to it.

"chapter_16_summary" : "God tells Ezekiel to tell the people of Jerusalem that their ancestry was in the land of Canaan, the product of a Amorite father and a Hittite mother. She (meaning Israel's ancestors) was abandoned, but God watched over her. When mature, God took her into covenant with Him, and she became His wife in marriage. God bathed, cleaned and adorned her so that her beauty was the envy of other nations. However, she trusted in her beauty and fame, prostituting herself to idols, and even using gifts, which God had provided to her, in her idol worship. She went on to sacrifice children to idols, without respect for what God had done for her. She prostituted herself to Egyptians, Philistines, Assyrians, and Babylonians. Actually, she was worse than a prostitute, because she offered her affections for free, and actively pursued illicit lovers by giving them gifts. Because of all this, God will sentence her to the fate of adulterers and murderers. He will gather all of her ex-lovers to strip her down and destroy her, thereby stopping her prostitution. Then God's jealousy and wrath will turn aside. She is like her mother the Hittite in that she despised her husband and children. Her older sister was Samaria, and her younger sister was Sodom, but her sins surpassed her sisters' sins. Sodom was haughty, \"arrogant, overfed and unconcerned\" and did detestable things, and had no pity to the poor and needy, so God destroyed them. Samaria did not do half of the sins she did. She has made Samaria and Sodom appear righteous. God will restore her, Samaria, and Sodom so that she will be ashamed in all that she has done. God will deal with her as she deserves for breaking the covenant, but He will still remember the covenant and will establish an everlasting covenant with her. When she is ashamed and remembers her ways, and then receives her sisters Samaria and Sodom, then He will give them to her as daughters. God will make atonement for her, and she will never again speak against God because of her humiliation.",

"chapter_17_summary" : "God tells Ezekiel to tell the people of Jerusalem a parable. A powerful eagle broke off the top of a Lebanon cedar tree and then planted it in a city of traders. The eagle also took seed and planted it by water, where it grew into a leafy vine. There was another powerful eagle, and the vine grew its roots and stretched its branches towards that eagle. This vine will not survive. This parable means that Babylon carried off Jerusalem's king, nobles, and leaders to Babylon, where they made an oath of treaty with the Babylonians. But the king unfaithfully sought help from Pharaoh of Egypt, thereby breaking the oath. Because this king broke the oath, God will ensure that the Egyptians and people of Judah are defeated. God Himself will take the top of a cedar and plant it on a mountain in Israel. It will become a big, fruit-producing tree where birds of every kind rest in it. The other trees will know that God humbles great trees and prospers little trees.",

A wicked man who does not will die. If the son of a wicked man instead acts righteously, that son will live. Each person is only responsible for their own actions. If a wicked man repents and acts just and right, he will then live and none of his sins will be remembered, and God is pleased if this happens. If a righteous man changes and acts wickedly, he will die and none of his righteousness will be remembered. The house of Israel may claim that God is unjust, but it is really they who are unjust.

God told Ezekiel to tell them that God will offer no guidance to them because of the sins their fathers committed. God had made a covenant with the Israelites to bring them from Egypt to the Promised Land, but they rebelled and continued worshiping Egyptian idols. So God punished them in Egypt, but then delivered them from their suffering for the sake of God's name. God gave them rules to live by in the desert, but they rebelled. So God punished them in the desert, but appealed to their children for the sake of God's name. Their children then rebelled. So God punished them in the desert, but not severely for the sake of God's name. God swore to them in the desert that they would be scattered throughout nations. God then let them do evil so that He could punish them to the point of horror. When God brought them into the Promised Land, they worshiped idols and committed pagan offerings, so God will not give them guidance. God will not let them worship idols, but will gather them together from the scattered nations in wrath into the desert, where face to face, God will judge them. Just like their forefathers coming out of Egypt, the unworthy will not enter Israel. So go ahead and worship idols, but God will force obedience. All of the Israelites will serve God and give Him offerings and sacrifices after He brings them from the scattered nations back into Israel. Then the Israelites will be shamed by their former actions, when God brings them back to Israel in His mercy for His name's sake. God tells Ezekiel to prophesy against the southern forest (Jerusalem) that God is about ready to set an all-consuming fire in the forest which everyone will know that God has set.

God tells Ezekiel to set up a signpost where the road forks to Jerusalem and to Rabbah. The king of Babylon will reach this fork and seek a sign of divination, and God will make the divination choose Jerusalem for attacking. The Israelites will be captured for their guilt. The time has come for Israel's punishment. God will exalt the low and bring the exalted down. Israel will be ruined and not restored until God gives it to its rightful owner.

Oholah gave herself to Egyptians as well as Assyrians, who were dressed in blue. Therefore, God gave her to the Assyrians, who killed her and took her children. Oholibah saw this, but continued her prostitution. Oholibah went even further by servicing both the Assyrians and the red Babylonians. She then despised the Babylonians and sought after the Egyptians instead because they had big genitals and lots of semen. Therefore, God will bring His wrath in the form of her ex-lovers, the Assyrians and Babylonians. They will strip her wealth, take her children, cut off her nose and ears, and kill all the rest.

So cook the stew, eat it, and set the empty pot on the fire to burn its deposits away. But the deposits will not burn away, just like the sins of the Israelites. So God will cleanse them through His wrath. God will act now without pity or relent. God told Ezekiel that He will kill his wife, but Ezekiel must not outwardly mourn her death. She dies. The Israelites inquire of Ezekiel. God tells Ezekiel to tell them that He is about to desecrate the sanctuary, the object of their affection, and kill the children they left behind.

They have provided hazardous support to the house of Israel, so God will punish them. Egypt will be without person or animal to the border of Cush (Upper Nile, Ethiopia) for forty years, and the Egyptians will be scattered in exile. After 40 years, God will return them from Exile. Then Egypt will be the lowest kingdom, never again ruling over another nation, and will remind the Israelites of their sin. On the first day of the first month of the twenty-seventh year, God told Ezekiel that the Babylonians fought hard against Tyre, but did not win. Therefore, God will give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar for the Babylonians to plunder as a reward for fighting against Tyre on God's behalf.

However, if the watchman provides no warning, his people will die because of their own sins, but their blood will be on the watchman's head. God has made Ezekiel watchman for the house of Israel, so he must warn them or be held accountable. God takes no pleasure in killing the wicked, but would rather them repent and live. A man's previous righteousness will not save him if he turns to sin. A man's previous wickedness will not kill him if he repents of it. This is God's justice, despite what man thinks of it. On the fifth day of the tenth month in the twelfth year of exile, a fugitive from Jerusalem told Ezekiel that the city was captured. God them made Ezekiel able to talk again (fulfilling the prophesy from Ezekiel 24).

God will search for the scattered people like a shepherd, returning them to the good pasture of Israel. God will nurse the injured people, but will destroy the strong ones. God will judge the people which he brings back to Israel too, purging out those who sin. God will have David be their leader, looking after them like a shepherd. God will be their God. God will give them peace; safety from beasts, drought, famine, plundering, and invasion. They will know that God is God when He rescues them from their oppressors.

Towns and ruins will be rebuilt. Men and animals will be fruitful. The nation will be more prosperous than before. Then Israel will know that God is God. Israel will never again be conquered, suffering life losses of its citizens from wars. Israel will not be the subject of scorn. God tells Ezekiel a prophesy for the Israelites. Before exile, the sins of the Israelites had been unclean to God, like a woman's period. So God punished them and scattered them throughout other nations. The other nations scorned God's name because of the exile. Therefore, not for the sake of Israel, but for the sake of God's name, He will do the following things to prove that He is holy so that the nations will know that God is God. God will bring the Israelites back to Israel and will clean their sins with water. God will give them a new heart and His spirit so that they will obey God's decrees and laws. God will prevent them from becoming unclean. They will have abundant crops and no famines, and this will remind them of their former sins and be ashamed. When their sins are cleansed, they will rebuild towns and ruins. The land will be farmed, becoming like the garden of Eden.

As Ezekiel spoke the prophesy, the bones became covered with flesh and skin. God tells Ezekiel to prophesy to the breath, to tell the four winds to enter and breath into the bodies. As Ezekiel spoke the prophesy, the bodies came to life and stood up as a vast army. God tells Ezekiel that the bones are the whole house of Israel. The Israelites claim that their bones are dry and their hope is gone. So Ezekiel should prophesy to them saying that God will bring them up from the grave and back to Israel. Then God's people will know that God is God. God will put His spirit in them. God tells Ezekiel to write \"Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him\" on one stick and \"Ephraim's stick, belonging to Joseph and all the house of Israel associated with him\" on another stick. Then Ezekiel is to john the sticks together. He is to tell the Israelites that this means that God will gather the scattered Israelites back to Israel, rejoining kingdoms of Judah and Samaria. There will be one king over them, and will never again become two nations. God will cleanse them and keep them from sinning. They will be God's people, and He will be their God.

But when Gog and his allies attack Israel, God will cause a massive earthquake with His presence, scaring all living creatures, flipping mountains, and making every wall fall.
