// This is a compromise versification system, intended to allow encoding of Bibles using a number of slightly varying LXX-based versification systems. In particular, it was produced in consultation with OTs:
// Rahlfs', Swete's, Tischendorf's, & Thomson's editions of the LXX
// the NETS, SAAS (OSB OT), Brenton, & Asser translations
// R. H. Charles' & James H. Charlesworth's anthologies of Apocrypha & Pseudepigrapha
// Henry E. J. Howard's Pentateuch and R. R. Ottley's Isaiah translations from the LXX

// In addition to the LXX OT, the GNT has been included in this system to facilitate production of modern Bibles such as the OSB, which are translated from the LXX but include the NT as well. The following NTs were consulted in producing this versification system:
// Antoniades' Patriarchal GNT and its translation, the EOB
// the NKJV (OSB NT) & NRSV translations

// All of these Bibles & texts should be accomodated by this versification definition without requiring that any extra verses be appended; as a consequence, no Bible will include every verse of this system.
