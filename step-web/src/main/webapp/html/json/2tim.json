"book_description" : "Paul's farewell",
"book_overview" : "Paul's final words: Keep going, and don't get entangled by sin or heresy",
"ESV_summary" : "Paul wrote this letter as he awaited execution. Despite all that Paul was facing—death, the end of his ministry, abandonment by most of his friends for fear of persecution—he faithfully directed his spiritual son Timothy to the hope that is in Christ. As he exhorted Timothy to boldness, endurance, and faithfulness in the face of false teaching, Paul showed his customary concern for sound doctrine. Scripture, said Paul, is \"breathed out by God\" and is sufficient in all things pertaining to the faith and practice of Christians (3:16-17). Older believers, therefore, should be eager to pass on their knowledge of Scripture to those who are younger in the faith (2:2). Paul probably wrote from Rome, AD 67 or 68.",
"ESV_introduction" : "Along with the letter to Titus, these writings are defined as \"pastoral epistles\", which approach the material from the perspective of the minister, not of the Church. The letters to Timothy discuss such matters as the duties and qualifications of church officers, the inspirations of Scripture, the treatment of widows, and the expectation of a future reward.",
"chapter_1_header" : "Bearing opposition",
"chapter_1_description" : "Fan the flame of faith without shame",
"chapter_1_overview" : "Paul, to Timothy my son. Fan into flame the gift of God. Share in suffering for the gospel. Hold to the standard of sound teaching.",
"chapter_1_summary" : "Paul begins by encouraging Timothy to be strong in his faith, reminding him of the sincere faith that his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice had, which is now in him. Paul urges Timothy not to be ashamed of the testimony of Jesus or of Paul, who is in prison, and speaks about his own suffering for the Gospel, encouraging Timothy to hold on to the faith and the teachings he has received..",
"chapter_2_description" : "Endure hardship as faithful soldier",
"chapter_2_overview" : "No soldier gets entangled with civilian affairs. Present yourself to God as an approved worker. Cleanse yourself for honourable use.",
"chapter_2_summary" : "Paul instructs Timothy to be a good soldier of Christ, emphasizing the need for perseverance in the face of hardship, and encouraging Timothy to pass on the teachings he has received to reliable people who will teach others. Paul uses metaphors of a soldier, an athlete, and a farmer to illustrate the qualities needed for effective ministry, and reminds Timothy to focus on Jesus Christ and His resurrection.",
"chapter_3_description" : "Scripture equips for every good work",
"chapter_3_overview" : "In the last days people will be proud and unholy. As for you, continue in what you have learned. All Scripture is inspired by God.",
"chapter_3_summary" : "Paul warns of difficult times that will come in the last days, describing people who will be self-centered, lovers of money, and disobedient. He advises Timothy to avoid such people and to continue in what he has learned from the Scriptures. Paul asserts that all Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.",
"chapter_4_header" : "Preach faithfully",
"chapter_4_description" : "Finish the race, keep the faith",
"chapter_4_overview" : "Preach the word in and out of season. I have finished my race. Come to me soon with Mark. Beware of Alexander. The Lord be with you.",
"chapter_4_summary" : "Paul gives Timothy a solemn charge to preach the Word of God, warning that there will be a time when people will not want to hear the sound teaching and will turn to those who teach falsehood. Paul reflects on his own life, stating that he has fought the good fight and kept the faith, encouraging Timothy to fulfill his ministry and remain steadfast.",
