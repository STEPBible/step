Diatheke Suite
by Chris Little <chrislit@crosswire.org>

This suite is intended for use with libraries and modules from
the SWORD Project, available at http://www.crosswire.org/

The latest versions of this suite and its components are available
at http://www.crosswire.org/sword/diatheke

This suite consists of the following components:

Diatheke - a command line utility, good for lots of stuff
Diatheke/CGI - a PERL CGI module interface to Diatheke 4.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING Diatheke/CGI

To install Diatheke/CGI, first install PERL and a webserver such as
Apache that is capable of running PERL CGIs.  Installing mod_perl is
recommended for a speed improvement, but is by no means necessary.

Then copy the two .pl files from the ./cgi directory of this
distribution into your cgi-bin directory.  Modify the top of
diatheke.pl to reflect the correct location of your your diatheke
command line utility binary and the default font if necessary. The
CGI is now installed and ready for access.

diatheke.pl is the main lookup script.  dia-def.pl is a supplemental
script used to set a default Bible translation (saved on the 
user's computer as a cookie).

Two sample HTML files are included as sample interfaces for an
general Web-Bible gateway.  index-public.html includes all currently
available free texts while index-private.html includes all currently
available texts, including those which are encrypted because
of copyright and distribution restrictions.  In any case, you should
only use these as a guide, adding and subtracting modules depending
on which modules you have installed and have permission to publish
on the internet or your intranet.  The bottom section of each file
includes an example call to the dia-def.pl script to set a default
Bible version.

You may also direct users directly to your perl script since it will
present a page with all of your modules.  Or you may wish to use this
default page to create a custom index.html for your users.
