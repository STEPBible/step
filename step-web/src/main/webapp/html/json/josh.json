"book_overview" : "Wars with the occupants and neighbours of Palestine; dividing the land.",
"ESV_summary" : "The five books of Moses anticipated the fulfillment of Godâ€™s promise to Abraham regarding the Promised Land. Now (either about 1400 or 1220 BC), through a string of military victories under Joshua, Israel conquered the land and divided it among the twelve tribes. In these battles it became evident that God fights for his people when they are \"strong and courageous\" (1:6, 7, 9, 18; 10:25) and put their full trust in him. At the close of the book, Joshua charged the people to remain faithful to God and to obey his commands, and the people agreed to do so. \"As for me and my house,\" said Joshua, \"we will serve the LORD\" (24:15). Although anonymous, the book appears to contain eyewitness testimony, some of which may have been written by Joshua himself.",
"ESV_introduction" : "This book serves as the connecting link between the Pentateuch and the later historical books; it name is derived from the principal character, Joshua. Chapters 1 to 23 describe the conquest of the land and it division among the tribes of Israel. In the final chapters (23-24), Joshua, somewhat after the fashion of Moses, exhorts the people in a series of farewell addresses \"to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses,\" and solemnly challenges them to the renewal of their covenant commitment to God.",

The 2 spies go to Jericho and stay the night in an inn, or possibly a prostitute's house, run by Rahab. The king of Jericho recognizes that the spies are there, and they are from the Israelites, so the king sends for the spies. Rahab hid the 2 spies and lied to the guards, saying the spies left before the city gate was closed. Rahab explains that God has put the fear of the Israelites in her people and makes a deal to protect her and her family since she protected the spies. The spies say to keep this secret, and tie a scarlet cord in her window, and thereby all in her house will be saved. Then the spies sneak back and report the people are melting in fear to Joshua.",

Joshua says to the people when the Ark of the Covenant enters the Jordan, its water will stop and rise up in a heap as a sign that God is with the Israelites and will drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites without fail. As soon as the priests' feet touch the Jordan (which was flooded at the time) its upstream water began heaping near a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the rest of the Jordan drained dry.

The 12 did this to serve as a reminder. 40,000 armed men from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed the Jordan in front of the other Israelites. As soon as the priests with the Ark left the riverbed, the waters returned. The Israelites treated Joshua as they did Moses since God exalted him. The stones were placed at Gilgal, on the eastern border of Jericho, where the Israelites camped that night. The stones are a reminder to fear God forever.",

For 6 days, all the armed men matched once around the city, followed by the priests carrying the Ark, while 7 priests blew 7 trumpets. On the seventh day, the same group marched 7 times around the city. For the 7th march, Joshua gave the instructions for the men to shout, for the wall will collapse, and Rahab's household should be spared, and all gold, silver, bronze, and iron spoils belong to God, and they should stay away from \"devoted things\", things that should be destroyed for God. The men shouted. The wall collapsed. The men killed every living thing in the city, including the livestock, with the exception of Rahab and her family for saving the spies. The metal spoils were put in God's treasury. Then the city was burned. Joshua cursed anyone who would rebuild Jericho, saying it will cost that man his first born and his youngest son.

God tells Joshua that He will point out the guilty party, and everything that belongs to that person, as well as the plunder, must be destroyed. Achan is identified and Achan admits his wrongdoing.

Then the combined 30,000 attacked the army of Ai. All 12,000 people from Ai were killed, and the king was hanged and then buried under a pile of rocks at the destroyed city's gates that's still there to this day.

The Israelites pursued them. God killed many more with huge hailstones. Joshua asked God to make the sun and the moon stand still until the nation was avenged. God does this. There has never been a day before or since when God listened to a man. Joseph locked the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon in a cave where they hid while his army destroyed almost all of the rest of the retreating armies. Then Joseph commanded his army commanders to get the 5 kings from the cave and step on their necks. Then Joseph killed the kings, hung them until nightfall, then buried them under stones at the mouth of the cave. Then his army attacked and devastated Mekkedah, killing all inhabitants. Successively, Joshua and his army devastated and slaughtered all at Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, and Debir.
