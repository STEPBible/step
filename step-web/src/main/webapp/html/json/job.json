"book_overview" : "Job lost everything because God agreed to let Satan test his faith; but he and his friends don't know why it happened.",
"ESV_summary" : "Considered both a theological and a literary masterpiece, the book of Job is an honest portrayal of God allowing a good man to suffer. The test of Job’s faith, allowed by God in response to a challenge from Satan, revealed God’s loving sovereignty and the supremacy of divine wisdom over human wisdom (personified by Job’s friends). Believing that God is good despite the apparent evidence to the contrary, Job rested in faith alone. In the depths of agony he could still proclaim, \"I know that my Redeemer lives\" (19:25). In the end God silenced all discussion with the truth that he alone is wise (chs. 38–41). Yet he vindicated Job’s trust in him (ch. 42), proving that genuine faith cannot be destroyed. The unknown author was probably an Israelite writing sometime between 1500 and 500 BC",
"ESV_introduction" : "So named from Job, its chief character, the book deals with an ageless question, one that is puzzling to every generation - the problem of human suffering, particularly the affliction of the righteous. The reader is given an account of the sufferings of the pious Patriarch Job, of the argument carried on between Job and his friends as to the cause of his sufferings, and finally, of the solution to his difficulty,. The book’s principal aim is to refute the popular view that all suffering is the result of sin in the life of the sufferer.",

"chapter_1_summary" : "Job lived in Uz and was the richest man there; with 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, 500 oxen, 500 donkeys, and lots of servants. God considered Job blameless. Job would purify his children after regular feasts and offer burnt offerings to God every morning just in case his children sinned. Angels, including Satan, come before God. God asks Satan where he has been. Satan says he was wondering earth. God brags to Satan about Job. Satan claims that it is only because God protects and blesses Job that he is so righteous, but if God were to take Job's possessions, Job would curse God. God agrees to let Satan deal with Job's possessions. After that, one day came when Sabeans captured Job's oxen and donkeys while killing the attending servants, fire of God fell from the sky and killed Job's sheep and the attending servants, Chaldeans captured Job's camels and killed the attending servants, and all of Job's children were killed when a house collapsed on them.

God boasts about Job again, saying that he is blameless even though Satan incited God to ruin him for no reason.

Satan afflicted Job with sores from head to toe. Job scrapes himself with a pottery shard while sitting in ashes. Job's wife tells Job to curse God and die. Job tells her she is foolish, and that people should accept both good and bad from God.

"chapter_9_overview" : "Job said, \"How can a man dispute with God? His power is vast! But he destroys the innocent. If only there were a mediator between us!\"",
"chapter_9_summary" : "Job asks how can a mortal be righteous. He notes how superior God is to man; being infinitely wise, being omnipotent, controlling the sun and the stars, making the constellations, being imperceivable, and being unrestrained in anger. Job asks how is it possible for him to argue with God, and says that even in his innocence he could not answer God. He can only beg for God's mercy. He says that if he asked God for a hearing, God would multiply his wounds for no reason. He says God destroys the righteous and the wicked, like when some plague brings sudden death, for who else but God could cause events like that to happen? Job says that even if he were to change his countenance and develop hope, everyone would still consider him guilty of some great sin. He says God is not like a man that can be taken to court, and that there is nobody that can serve as an arbitrator for God. Because there is no arbitrator, Job claims he can't dispute with God.",

"chapter_10_summary" : "Because Job hates his life, he questions God and asks what are the charges that God has against him. He asks if God is pleased with making him suffer while He blesses the wicked. He asks God why He is probing for his sin when God knows he is innocent. He reminds God that He made him and blessed him. Job knows that God planned to punish him if he sinned, and if he has sinned, he deserves the punishment. But if he has not sinned, he can't even hold his head high or else God will apply even more wrath to him. Job asks why did God even make him to be born.
