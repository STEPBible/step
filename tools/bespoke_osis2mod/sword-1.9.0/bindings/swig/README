Building the SWIG Bindings
==========================

You may need to do the following to get this to work. From this directory:

cd package

# Special step for BSD-liks (e.g. Mac OS X):
# edit autogen.sh to remove the "-a" option from cp

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

# Rather than make, you probably only care about one of the languages bindings.
# So you might try one of these pairs of commands instead:
# 
make perlswig
make perl_make
cd perl
sudo make install

#
# or
#

make pythonswig
make python_make
cd python
sudo python setup.py install
