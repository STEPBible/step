Gen.1	God creates the heavens and the earth. The earth and heavens are water. Then He creates light. He separates light from darkness, and this becomes the definition of day and night. That was the first day as we know it. On the second day, God separates the earth waters and heaven waters with sky. On the third day, God moves all the water on the earth to one place called seas, and the rest of the earth, now dry, was called land; and He made every type of plant, and the plants that grow on that land that bear seed, and plants that had seeds in fruit; and those seeds would make the same types of plants from which they came. On the fourth day, God made the sun and the moon and the stars to mark seasons, days, and years. On the fifth day, God made every type of bird and every type of creature in the ocean. On the sixth day, God made every type of creature that moves on the land; and God created man in His image; and God created woman; and God told man to fill the earth with his offspring and rule it; and God told man that man governs over everything on earth; and God said seed-bearing plants and fruit bearing trees will be man's food, while everything else (except the creatures in the sea) will eat green plants for food. Everything that God created was labeled as good.
Gen.2	The seventh day was holy, blessed by God when He rested on that day. During the creation of the earth, streams sprung up from the ground to water the earth. God made man from the dust of the earth and breathed the breath of life into his nose. God made a garden, which was full of pretty trees that were good for food, called Eden and He placed man there to live and to tend to the garden. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God said to man that he could eat the fruit of any tree in the garden except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for he will die if he does eat of that tree. God parades the birds, the livestock, and the beasts of the field in front of man for him to name. The man, now called <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler>Adam</jLink></jLink></jLink>, is put to sleep by God. During <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler>Adam</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sleep, God takes part of him (a rib) from which to make a woman. Thereby, husband and wife together shall be considered one flesh.
Gen.3	The serpent convinces the woman to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and the woman in turn convinces man to eat of the same tree. Suddenly they realize they are naked and make clothing out of fig leaves. The serpent is cursed by God for this action, making it crawl on its belly and be attacked by man. The woman is cursed by God to have increased pain in child birth and to be ruled by her husband. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler>Adam</jLink></jLink></jLink> is cursed by God with having to work the land hard for food, saying he will eat the plants of the field.

Gen.6	The “sons of God” married the daughters of men. Humans will live no more than 120 years from now on. The <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5303' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5303' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5303' clickHandler>Nephilim</jLink></jLink></jLink> had offspring with the daughters of man. Men thought only of evil all the time. God was sorry He ever made man and said He would wipe every creature off the earth. But <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the one and only man of the time that did not sin. God walked with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> make a big boat, because He will flood the earth and all life under the heavens will perish with the exception of the life on that boat. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> is to bring his three sons, their wives, and two of every kind of creature on the face of the earth, male and female, on the boat. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> is to gather and store every type of food needed by the animals that will be eaten during the flood. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> did what God told him to do.
Gen.7	Now God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to bring seven male/female pairs of every kind of clean animals, two pairs of every kind of unclean animals, and seven pairs of every kind of bird to preserve all of these creatures throughout the earth; for He will flood the earth in seven days and kill every living creature on the face of the earth. The flood began when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was 600 years old, in 1656 AC. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his wife, his sons and their wives all board the boat, as did all the previously noted pairs of animals under Gods will. It rained for forty days and forty nights; the floodgates of the heavens opened and springs of the great deep burst open. The water on the earth rose high enough to cover the highest mountain by at least twenty feet. Every living thing on the face of the earth was destroyed. The waters flooded the earth for 150 days.
Gen.8	The floodgates of the heavens closed, and springs of the great deep closed. God made wind drive back the water. After a while, the boat settled on a mountain. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> sent out a raven and a dove to look for dry land. No luck. He waited seven days and sent the dove out again. It returned with an olive leaf. About a year after the flood had began, it was over. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to bring everything out of the boat and to go forth and multiply. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> took some clean animals and clean birds and made a burnt offering of them. God says that even though man is evil, He will never again destroy all living creatures. "As long as the earth endures, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.

Gen.12	God tells Abram to move to a different location and at that location, his offspring will prosper, and others will be blessed or cursed according to how they treat his offspring. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> Abram sets out for the land of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler>Canaan</jLink></jLink></jLink> with his wife and his nephew <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink> in 2024 AC.

The men of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> were wicked. Abram lived in the land of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler>Canaan</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God tells Abram to look around; all that he sees will be given to his offspring forever and his offspring will be innumerable. Abram settles near the altar at the site of the great tree of Moreh at <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7927G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7927G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7927G' clickHandler>Shechem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Gen.14	There was a war in which <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler>Gomorrah</jLink></jLink></jLink> were pillaged and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink> was captured. A person escaped and reported this to Abram. Abram was with the <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler>Amorites</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> Abram takes 318 trained men from his household to rescue <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He came upon the captors at <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1835H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1835H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1835H' clickHandler>Dan</jLink></jLink></jLink> and routed them. He continued pursuing them to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2327' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2327' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2327' clickHandler>Hobah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, north of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler>Damascus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and there defeated the King Kedorlaomer. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink>, his possessions, the women, and other people were rescued. The rescued King of Salem (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>), <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4442' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4442' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4442' clickHandler>Melchizedek</jLink></jLink></jLink>, blessed Abram, and Abram gave him a tithe. The King of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> said to Abram that he just needs the people, and Abram can keep everything else. Abram tells the King of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> that he will not take anything (except room and board) from him for fear that the he will try to take credit for Abram's wealth.
Gen.15	In a vision God tells Abram He on his side. Abram complains about lacking an heir. God says that his offspring will be innumerable. God tells him to kill some animals for an offering. Abram falls asleep. God tells Abram that his descendents will be enslaved and mistreated for 400 years in a different country. Then, the fourth generation will leave that land to come back with great possessions. At that time, they'll smite the <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler>Amorites</jLink></jLink></jLink> when the <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0567' clickHandler>Amorites</jLink></jLink></jLink> are full of sin. Abram's lineage will inherit land from the Wadi of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler>Euphrates</jLink></jLink></jLink> River.
Gen.16	Since Sarai was barren, she offered her maidservant, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler>Hagar</jLink></jLink></jLink>, to Abram to bear children. Conflict between the two women makes <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler>Hagar</jLink></jLink></jLink> leave when she is pregnant. The “Angel of the Lord” tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1904' clickHandler>Hagar</jLink></jLink></jLink> to go back and serve Sarai, to name her future child <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3458G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3458G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3458G' clickHandler>Ishmael</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and that the child will grow up in conflict in with everyone. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3458G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3458G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3458G' clickHandler>Ishmael</jLink></jLink></jLink> was born in 2035 AC.
Gen.17	In 2048 AC, God tells Abram it's time for Him to make good on His promise. He says to Abram that he is now <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and he'll keep his side of the promise by circumcising any male among him that is not just a guest; babies are to get circumcised at eight days old. Sarai will be called <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler>Sarah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and will bear children. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> laughs, saying they're too old to have children. (Abram was 99 years old. Sarai was 89 years old.) God says the son should be called <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3327' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3327' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3327' clickHandler>Isaac</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and he'll bear 12 rulers. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> circumcises all the males that day.
Gen.18	God appeared to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> looked up and saw three men. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the men to rest under that tree; that he'd wash their feet, feed, and refresh them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler>Sarah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to fetch water and bake bread. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to the flock and got a choice calf, curds, and milk. God/They said I'll return next year and your wife will have a son. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler>Sarah</jLink></jLink></jLink> heard this and laughed. God asked why did she laugh? She said she didn't. He said yes you did. The men turn towards <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> walked with them. God reasons with Himself, and then tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> He's going down personally to check out <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler>Gomorrah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The other men continued onward, but God stayed while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> questioned him. Abram asks if there are righteous among the towns, will God still destroy the towns?
Gen.19	The two male angels get to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> at night, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink> invites them into his house.

The angels blinded the Sodomites so that they couldn't find the door. Then they told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink> that they would destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and that he and his family should leave, and that they can't look back. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sons-in-law, to which his daughters were pledged, thought he was joking when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained this to them. After arguing about the place to run, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink> took his wife and daughters out of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6820' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6820' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6820' clickHandler>Zoar</jLink></jLink></jLink>. As he was leaving, his wife looked back and was instantly turned to a pillar of salt. God rained burning sulfur on the towns of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler>Gomorrah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and their surrounding lands. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink> was frightened and decided to move to the mountains like the angels had asked him to do at the beginning, taking his two daughters. Having no other men and wanting children, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3876G' clickHandler>Lot</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s daughters got him drunk and then slept with him.

God reacted by sealing every womb in the household. God came to the king in a dream and said that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8283' clickHandler>Sarah</jLink></jLink></jLink> is a married woman.

Judah's wife died. After a while, Judah went to help the men shearing his sheep.

They agreed on the price of a young goat. But because he didn't have the goat with him, Judah gave his seal and its cord, and his staff as a promise until the goat could be given to her. They had sex and she was impregnated. Immediately after Judah left, she put back on her widow's clothes and left. Judah sent his friend to pay the prostitute the goat, but she wasn't there. When Judah asked around town, no one knew of the prostitute. Three months later, people claimed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8559G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8559G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8559G' clickHandler>Tamar</jLink></jLink></jLink> was impregnated because of prostitution.

Exo.12	God describes how the Passover will work and how it is to be celebrated in the years to come, and says that this will be the first month of the Hebrew year. Now: Slaughter a defect-free male lamb (sheep or goat) at twilight. Paint the top and sides of the door jamb with blood form the lamb so God will know to pass by that household. Eat bread without yeast. Cook the lamb over the fire whole. Burn any leftovers before morning. Eat it quickly, fully clothed, with staff in hand. In years to come: Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. No yeast can be in the house and you can eat nothing with yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day to the evening of the twenty-first day. Cut off anyone who has yeast in this time. Do no work on the fourteenth or the twenty-first.

The Israelites saw the oncoming Egyptians and complained to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells the Israelites not to worry because God is on their side.

Then God moved between the Egyptians and the Israelites, as did the pillar of cloud to keep the Egyptians away. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> raised his staff and so God sent a <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6924A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6924A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6924A' clickHandler>East</jLink></jLink></jLink> strong wind to drive the water back all night long. There was a path of dry land between two walls of water that the Israelites took to go across. The Egyptians pursued the Israelites. God confused the army and broke their chariots. After the Israelites made it across, God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> to raise his hand to let the sea come back together. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> does that and all of the Egyptian army dies in the water. The Israelites now feared God, and trusted in God and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Exo.15	There is a song that praises God and rehashes the story just told. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> leads the Israelites through the Desert of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7793' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7793' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7793' clickHandler>Shur</jLink></jLink></jLink> for three days without water.

Exo.16	In the Desert of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler>Sin</jLink></jLink></jLink>, on day fifteen of the second month since leaving, the people grumbled about not having food. God rains bread (manna) from heaven each night with the instructions that for six days the Israelites will collect this manna, and on the sixth day they are to collect twice what they need, because there will be no manna the seventh day. This will repeat itself every seven days. As <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink> was telling the Israelites this, God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> that He will also bring meat to the Israelites in the evening. That evening quail settled all over the camp. In the morning the ground was cover with thin, white manna that tasted like wafers made with honey. The people collected what they needed, and manna not collected, melted away. Some Israelites angered <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> by saving manna for the next day. The leftover manna was full of maggots and it stunk. On the sixth day, the people collected twice the regular manna. The seventh day the leftovers were OK. But some people still looked for manna on the seventh day. The people observed the Sabbath on the seventh day. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> to save an omer of manna for future generations to see.

Also, punishable by death, the people and animals are to stay off the mountain until a ram's horn is blown. On the third day, there was a dense cloud of thunder and lightening on the mountain. A trumpet blast assembled the people at the foot of the mountain. God came upon the mountain in smoke and fire. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> spoke and God replied with thunder.

Exo.21	God says: A Hebrew male servant is to be free after 6 years, taking with him whatever possessions he had at the time when he was bought. If his master gave the servant a wife, the wife and children belong to the master. The male servant can elect to serve for life. Female servants are not to be freed. Her master can't sell her to a foreigner. If the master's son marries her, the master must treat her like a daughter. If the son takes another wife, he must continue to treat the servant girl as a wife or else she is free to go. A person who intentionally kills another person shall be killed. A person who accidentally kills another person shall be allowed to flee to a location of God's choice. A person who attacks or kills his parent shall be killed. Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be killed. A person who curses either of his parents shall be killed. A person who beats another to injury must pay for any time lost from that injury. If a man beats a slave to death, he is to be punished; but he is not punished if the slave is injured temporarily. If men hit a pregnant woman and she miscarries, the men are to meet the husband's and the court's demands. If there is serious injury during fighting, you should take take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. If a man punctures an eye or breaks a tooth of a servant, the servant is free to go. If a bull kills a person, the bull is to be stoned to death and the owner is blameless; except if the owner knew of this type behavior in his bull, in which case the owner will be stoned as well unless payment is demanded instead; except if a slave is gored, in which case the bull owner owes the slave owner thirty shekels of silver. Killed animals shall be payed for in one method or another.
Exo.22	God says: A livestock thief must repay fivefold for ox and fourfold for sheep he kills or sells. A thief caught and killed at night shall leave the owner guiltless; but if the thief is killed in the day, the owner is guilty of bloodshed. A thief must payback or be enslaved. If the animal is found alive with the thief, the thief must payback double. If a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and lets them stray and they graze in another man's field, he must make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard. A fire-starter must make restitution for what is burned. Any case of lost property about which two people claim 'This is mine,' both parties are to bring their cases before the judges and the one whom the judges declare guilty must pay back double to his neighbor. If a man watches an animal for his neighbor and it dies or is injured or is taken away while no one is looking, the issue between them will be settled by the taking of an oath before God that the neighbor did not lay hands on the other person's property. The owner is to accept this, and no restitution is required. But if the animal was stolen while under watch, he must make restitution to the owner. If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal, he shall bring in the remains as evidence and he will not be required to pay for the torn animal. If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, he must make restitution. If the animal was hired, the money paid for the hire covers the loss. If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife. If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins. Kill sorceresses. Kill those that have sexual relations with an animal. Kill anyone that makes sacrifices to any other god. Don't mistreat an alien or oppress him. God will kill someone who takes advantage of a widow or an orphan. If you lend money to a fellow Israelite, charge no interest {or excessive interest}. If you take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, return it to him by sunset. Don't blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people. Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats. Sacrifice the firstborn of your sons, doing the same with your cattle and your sheep, on the eighth day of their lives. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but give them to God on the eighth day. Don't eat the meat of an animal torn by wild beasts.
Exo.23	God says: Don't spread false reports. Don't help a wicked man by being a malicious witness. Don't follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, don't show favoritism to a poor man in his lawsuit. If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to take it back to him. If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; be sure you help him with it. Don't deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits. Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent or honest person to death. Don't accept a bribe. Don't oppress an alien.  For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops, vineyard, and olives, but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused. Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work. Don't invoke the names of other gods.  Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Celebrate the Feast of Harvest. Celebrate the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in your crops from the field. Don't cook a young goat in its mother's milk. God says that He's sending an angel ahead to guard the Israelites in their journey, and the angel will not forgive rebellion.

Exo.34	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> to bring two new stone tablets up the mountain to be inscribed. God describes himself as “The LORD , the LORD , the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.” God had <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> carve the laws below in the tablets and labeled them as the Ten Commandments: No worshiping of any god other than God. No making of cast idols. Keep the feast of unleavened bread. The firstborn offspring of every womb is to be sacrificed to God. Observe the Sabbath. Observe the feast of weeks. All male children must appear before God three times per year. The blood of a sacrifice shall not be offered together with yeast, nor shall the sacrifice of the Passover feast be left until the next morning. The best of the firstfruits of the land are to be brought before God. Don't boil a baby goat in its mother's milk. This time and every time after, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>' face glowed after talking with God. He covered his face with a veil when talking to others.
Exo.35	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> reminds the people of the Sabbath, stating that no one can light a fire in their house on the seventh day as well. Materials are gathered for the tabernacle and the construction work is started on it.
Exo.36	They got enough material, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells the people to stop bringing material. The tabernacle is made.
Exo.37	The Ark is made. The Table is made. The Lamp Stand is made. The Altar of Incense is made.
Exo.38	The Altar of Burnt Offerings is made. The Washing Basin is made. The Courtyard is made. A census was taken for silver collection, with 603,550 men being counted.
Exo.39	The various priestly garments are made. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> inspected the work and blessed them for doing it just as instructed.
Exo.40	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> to set up and consecrate the tabernacle as previously instructed on the first day of the first month, and to consecrate <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the other priests from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s lineage. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> did this, including putting the stone tablets of the Testimony in the Ark. When God dwelt in the tabernacle as a cloud by day or fire by night, the Israelites did not travel.
Lev.1	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> how to make burnt flesh offerings. If the offering is a bull, it must be without defect, and the person making the offering is to lay his hand on the bulls head to signify it for atonement of sins. The blood will be put on the altar. All parts are to be burned. Sheep or goats without defect can be offered. Doves or young pigeons can be offered, though the crop of the bird is to be thrown on the ashes instead of burned. The smell of burnt flesh pleases God.
Lev.2	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> how to make burnt grain offerings. No yeast or honey should used. Salt, oil, and incense should be used. Only part of the grain offering is to be burnt, while the rest belongs to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his sons.
Lev.3	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> how to make fellowship, or peace, offerings. Fellowship offerings are to be made from an animal without defect. The person making the offering is to put his hand on the head of the animal. The animal's fat and kidneys are to be burnt. People are not to eat the body fat or blood.
Lev.4	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> how to make sin offerings. If a priest unintentionally sins, a bull without defect is to be slaughtered after that priest places his hand on the bull's head. Its blood is to be sprinkled in front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. The bull's fat and kidneys are to be burnt at the altar, while the rest of the bull is to be burnt outside the camp. If the community sins unintentionally, even if they didn't know it was a sin and later found out about it, the process is the same except all of the elders of the community lay their hands on the bull's head. If a leader unintentionally sins, then the same process is followed except a male goat is used and no seven sprinklings are needed (or at least they are not explicitly required). If a community member unintentionally sins, then the process is the same as for the leader, except a female goat or female sheep is to be used.
Lev.5	God says: Testify if you know something about the case. Don't touch anything unclean. Don't make hasty promises. Transgressing the actions above require a sin offering. If that person can't afford a lamb or goat, then two pigeons or doves are to be used. If that person can't afford two pigeons or doves, then fine flour is to be used. If a person unintentionally sins against holy things, a ram of proper value must be offered, and a fifth of the value is to be given to the priests. If a person unintentionally sins he must offer a ram without defect and of proper value.
Lev.6	God says: If a neighbor cheats another neighbor out of property, he must return it, plus a fifth of the value and also make a ram guilt offering. Then God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> of the priests' requirements for the burnt, grain, and sin offerings. The priests can eat some of the grain and sin offerings. The priests must also make a daily grain offering.
Lev.7	Then God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> of the priests' requirements for the guilt and fellowship offerings. The priests get to keep the hides. People are not to eat the body fat or blood. The priests get a regular share of the offerings.
Lev.8	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> ordains <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his sons as priests. The priests stay outside the Tent of Meeting for seven days as part of this process and did what God commanded through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Lev.9	On the eighth day, the priests make offerings for themselves and for the people. At the end, God appeared before all of the people and there was much rejoicing.
Lev.10	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5070G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5070G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5070G' clickHandler>Nadab</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0030' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0030' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0030' clickHandler>Abihu</jLink></jLink></jLink>, two of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sons, burnt incense for God in a way not consistent with the instructions, so God burns them to death. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> says that priests cannot mourn those killed by God, such as by tearing their clothes or uncovering their heads, but the rest of the nation can mourn; otherwise those priests will be killed. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink> that the priests cannot have a fermented drink in the Tent of Meeting or they will be killed; and that they must teach the people what is clean and unclean, as well as all of God's commandments. The priests made a sin offering, but burnt it all. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> is angered that they did not eat any of the offering. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink> says he could not eat any because of what had just happened.
Lev.11	Clean and unclean animals are defined. Unclean animals are not to be touched or eaten. If a person is made unclean by these actions, the uncleanliness lasts until evening.
Lev.12	God says to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>: A woman is unclean during her period. A woman is unclean after giving birth for seven/fourteen days for a boy/girl. The boy must be circumcised on the eighth day. A woman is to be purified after giving birth at thirty-three/sixty-six days for a boy/girl. The purification is done through sin offering.
Lev.13	God says to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink>: If a person has a skin disease, he is unclean. An unclean person must uncover his head, cover his lower face, and shout “unclean”; and that person must live alone outside of the community. If an article of clothing gets mildew that will not go away, it should be burned, or the contaminated portion should be burned.
Lev.14	God says to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink>: Once a person is free of an infectious skin disease, they must be ceremonially cleaned. This is done with two birds, one killed over fresh water, the other dipped in the dead bird's blood and set free. There's much more, including shaving all the hair off the body and making a guilt offering. For a house which God inflicts with mildew, the house is to be purged of the mildew. If the house cannot be cleaned, then the house is to be torn down.
Lev.15	God says to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink>: People with bodily discharges, including semen and periods, are unclean. A man that has sex with a woman on her period will be unclean for seven days. Anything that unclean person uses, sits on, or lays on will be unclean. Other than semen, persons with discharges must go through a ceremonial cleaning seven days after the discharge passes.
Lev.16	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>: The priests are to make atonement for all the sins of the Israelites in front of the Atonement Cover on the Ark once a year on the tenth day of the seventh month. First the high priest will sacrifice a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, covering the priest's transgressions. Then he'll take two male goats for a sin offering for all of the Israelites. One goat will be sacrificed as a sin offering. The other will have all of the sins of the Israelites put on its head, and then get released in the desert, a.k.a. the scapegoat.
Lev.17	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>: The people must make their offerings in front of the Tent of Meeting. People should not eat blood. Life is in blood. Blood is for atonement. Blood eaters must be cut off from the people. Don't eat animals found dead or torn by wild animals.
Lev.18	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>: The people should not have sex with: close relatives, your mother, your father's wife, your father's daughter, your father's or mother's sister, your father's brother's wife, your son's wife, your brother's wife, a woman and her daughter or son's daughter or daughter's daughter as well, don't take your wife's sister as a rival wife while the first wife is living, and don't have sex with a woman on her period.

Then everyone is to stone the son to death. If a person kills a person, the killer must be killed. A person that kills another's animal must make restitution. Injuries are to by paid in kind, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This law holds for Israelites and aliens. The people stoned the son who blasphemed.
Lev.25	Observe a Sabbath year on the seventh year. There is to be a Year of Jubilee every fiftieth year. Treat this like a Sabbath year. This is to be a family reunion year, back on your original property. Don't take advantage of someone when selling your land. Sold land is to be returned to the previous owner, except for houses in walled cities, in the Year of Jubilee. Levites can always buy their land back, with the exception of houses in walled cities which have only a one year sell-back opportunity. Support poor Levites so they can live among you. Don't treat Israelite slaves ruthlessly. You can buy slaves.
Lev.26	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>: If the people obey God's laws, they will have an easy life with abundance and peace. Five Israelites will chase down one hundred enemies, and one hundred Israelites will chase down ten thousand enemies. God will dwell with them. If the people do not obey, they will be stricken with pestilence and famine, and attacked by wild animals and enemies. The Israelite population will be reduced to only a few and will be spread through the nations of their enemies. They will be so fearful of their enemies that they will run at the sound of a leaf in the wind. The people and the land will be decimated. If the people then repent, God will then keep His promise and they will be able to go back to the Promised Land.

The newly captured land east of the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler>Jordan</jLink></jLink></jLink> was divided among the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4519G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4519G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4519G' clickHandler>Manasseh</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> that he will lead the Israelites into the Promised Land.
Deu.4	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells the Israelites to obey the laws he is giving them, and do not add or subtract from them. Other nations will be impressed by these laws. Teach the laws from generation to generation. Do not make an idol, because God is jealous. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> will die on the east of the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler>Jordan</jLink></jLink></jLink>. If the people become wicked, God will drive them out of the Promised Land. But if they look for God then, He will be merciful to them. God is the only God and He brought the Israelites to the Promised Land. The following are the laws that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the people.
Deu.5	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> repeats the Ten Commandments: Have no God but God. Do not worship idols because God is jealous, punishing the family of those who hate Him down to their great grandchildren, showing love to those that love Him. Do not blaspheme. Observe the Sabbath. Honor your parents. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not give false testimony on your neighbor. Do not covet what your neighbor has. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> reminds the people to follow the commands of God.
Deu.6	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> says: Obey God's commands. Love God. Tell your children about God's commands when you sit at home, walk along the road, lie down, and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates. Do not worship other gods. Do not test God.
Deu.7	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> says: When you go into the Promised Land, you must destroy the inhabitants completely, showing no mercy. If you do not, they may convince you to start worshiping other gods, and God will destroy you quickly for that. Destroy all they hold sacred. You are the fewest people and God loves you. God loves those that love him and keep His commandments, but will quickly destroy those that hate Him. If you love God and keep His commandments, you will be blessed over all nations, including by not having closed wombs in people or livestock. Do not be afraid of the occupants of the Promised Land, even though they are greater in number. You saw how God plagued <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> and pulled us out of slavery. God will send hornets to kill those that hide from the Israelites. God will deliver the kings of the Promised Land to you. Do not bring anything detestable into your house.
Deu.8	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> says: Do not forget God. God brought you through the desert to test your hearts. God made you hungry and gave you manna to teach you man doesn't live by bread alone, but by the word of God. Your sandals and clothes didn't wear out in the 40 years in the desert. If you become proud and claim accomplishments as your own, God will kill you.
Deu.9	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> says: God is not giving the Israelites this land because they are righteous, rather because the inhabitants of this land are wicked, so He will drive the inhabitants out to keep His promise. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells how the Israelites angered God and how <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> had to pray and convince God not to destroy them.
Deu.10	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells how God wrote out the Ten Commandments on a second set of stone tablets. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink> died in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4149A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4149A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4149A' clickHandler>Moserah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> told how he was told to lead the Israelites. Fear God, for He is the biggest and owns everything. God shows no partiality, takes no bribes, defends the fatherless and the widow, and loves the alien. You are to love the alien too.
Deu.11	This basically repeats Deuteronomy 6, including how you are to remind yourselves of God's word. Added is that when the Israelites enter the Promised Land, they are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5858B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5858B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5858B' clickHandler>Ebal</jLink></jLink></jLink> the curses.
Deu.12	Destroy sacred things of other faiths. Worship and make offerings only in the chosen worship place. You can kill and eat other animals in your town, provided you do not eat their blood. Do not neglect the Levites. Do not inquire about other gods because they are worshiped in ways God detests, such as by burning to death their sons and daughters as sacrifices. Do not add to or take away from the Law.
Deu.13	Kill those that tell you to worship other gods. If a relative tells you to worship other gods, you must be the first to lay a hand on them towards killing them, and they must be stoned to death. If an entire town worships other gods, kill all the people and livestock, and burn all the plunder in the center of town, and never rebuild that city.
Deu.14	Clean and unclean animals are defined again, again calling a bat an unclean bird. Do not eat animals that are found dead, but you can give them to aliens or sell them to foreigners. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk. Make a tithe.
Deu.15	Every 7 years, debts must be canceled. There should be no poor among you, yet there will always be poor in the land. Give to the poor generously. At the seventh year, Hebrew slaves must be set free, and should be well supplied with livestock, grain, and wine. If the slave doesn't want to leave, puncture his or her earlobe with an awl against your door and he or she will then be a servant to you for life. The firstborn from the flocks and herds are to be sacrificed to God at the holy place of His choosing, unless the animal has defects. Do not eat blood.
Deu.16	Observe Passover. The bread without yeast is a remembrance that the bread made during the Exodus was unleavened. During Passover, you are to eat unleavened bread for seven days; and also six days. Observe the Feast of Weeks. Observe the Feast of Tabernacles. Men are to appear before God three times a year at these three events. Set up judges. Do not show partiality. Do not accept bribes. Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside an altar to God, and do not erect a sacred stone.
Deu.17	Do not sacrifice a flawed animal to God. If a person worships anything or anyone else but God, stone that person to death at the city gates. The witnesses should be the first stone throwers. For a capital sin, a person should only be put to death if there is more than one witness to their sin. Difficult lawsuits are to be judged by the priests. Do everything they give as their judgement or be put to death. Your kings are to be chosen by God. The king should not have many wives. The king should not amass great personal wealth. The king should read the Law of God every day. The king is not to consider himself better than anyone else.
Deu.18	The Levites are not to own anything. They are to live off offerings. Do not harbor anyone who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. God will provide a prophet like <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and from the Israelites. If the people do not listen to the prophet, God himself will reckon with that person. A false prophet, or a prophet of other gods must be put to death. You will know a false prophet by if what a prophet proclaims in the name of the God does not take place or come true.
Deu.19	Set aside three cities of refuge for people who kill people accidentally, otherwise an avenger of death may kill the murderer, thereby shedding innocent blood, thereby making the people guilty before God. If the people do what God tells them and God gives them all of the Promised Land, set up three more cities for refuge. A man who kills with malicious intent must be brought out a refuge city and killed. Do not move the boundary stones of inheritance. Two or more witnesses is enough to convict a man. For single witnesses, the case must be thoroughly investigated. If the witness is found to be a liar, he is to bear the punishment of the accused crime. Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
Deu.20	When going into battle against a city, do not be afraid because God is with you. Anyone who has a new home, has a new vineyard, is engaged to be married, or is fearful of battle is excused from battle. First offer peace to a city in exchange for becoming slave labor. If the offer is not accepted, lay siege to the city. When the siege is over, kill all the men, leave the women, children, and livestock for your own use. You may cut down non-fruit-bearing trees for making siege implements. However, for the cities in the Promised Land, anything that breaths is to be completely destroyed.
Deu.21	If there is an unsolved murder, the nearest town must sacrifice a cow that has not been worked, breaking its neck in a stream, to atone for the death. You may take a war-captured woman as your wife after she has mourned her parents for a month. If you are displeased with her, let her go free. If a man has two wives, one that he does not love, and one that he does love, the larger part of his inheritance must go to the firstborn son, regardless of which wife provided that son. A rebellious son should be proclaimed a profligate and a drunkard, and then stoned to death by all the men of the town. A person that is hung on a tree for a capital crime should be buried the same day.
Deu.22	Return lost livestock, or hold it for safekeeping until the owner looks for it. Help livestock that has stumbled. Do not be a cross-dresser. You may take young birds or eggs in a nest, but do not take the mother. Build fall protection for your roof. Do not plant two kinds of seed in a vineyard. Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together. Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear. If a man marries a woman, dislikes here, slanders her by saying she was not a virgin, and her parents produce proof of her virginity with a [bloody] cloth, then the man should be fined 100 shekels of silver and will have to stay married to her. If no proof can be found, the woman is to be stoned to death. If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the wife should be killed. If, in a city, a man rapes a virgin promised for marriage to another man, both the man and the ex-virgin are to be stoned to death, the ex-virgin because she did not scream loud enough. If, in the country, a man rapes a virgin promised for marriage to another man, just the man is to be killed. If a man rapes a virgin that is not promised for marriage to another man, the man must pay the ex-virgin's father 50 shekels of silver and marry her and never divorce her. A man is not to marry his father's wife.
Deu.23	No one with damaged or removed testicles or penis can enter the congregation. No bastard child, nor any of his lineage down to the 10th generation, may enter the congregation. No Ammonite or Moabite may enter the congregation. The Edomites and Egyptians may join the congregation after the third generation. When in a war camp, a man who has a nocturnal emission of semen is unclean until nightfall of the new day and must wait outside camp until then. When in a war camp, bury your waste products outside of camp. Protect a slave who takes refuge with you and let him go freely. Israelites should not become male or female prostitutes, for they are detestable to God. Do not take a prostitute's money for God. Only charge interest to foreigners for borrowed things. Repay any verbal vow quickly. You may have “all-you-can-eat” of your neighbor's vineyard or grain provided you do not take a to-go box.
Deu.24	If a man divorces a woman because he is displeased with her, giving her a certificate of divorce, he is not to remarry her if she remarries. A newlywed man is to stay at home pleasing his wife for one year. Do not take a man's livelihood as security for a debt. If an Israelite kidnaps an Israelite and sells him or treats him as a slave, the kidnapper must die. Treat skin diseases per the priest's recommendations. When you offer a loan to your neighbor, wait for him to bring you a pledge. If the neighbor is poor, return the pledge by sundown. Do not take advantage of the hired poor or needy. Pay a man each day. Fathers will not die for their children's sin, nor will the children die for their father's sin. Do not deprive the alien or orphan of justice. Do not take the cloak from a widow as a pledge. Only make one pass in your harvesting, leaving the missed harvest for the poor, the aliens, and the widows.
Deu.25	The judges will decide guilt and punishment. If there is punishment, the flogging will take place in front of the judge and shall not be more than 40 lashes. Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. If a married man dies before having a son, one of his brothers must marry that man's wife and name the firstborn son after the dead man. However, if the brother refuses to do this, the widow, in front of the village elders, will take off one of the brother's sandals, spit in his face, and say that is what he deserves. If two men are fighting and a wife of one of them seizes her husband's assailant's testicles to try and rescue her husband, the wife's hand must be cut off. Use accurate weights and measures. The Israelites will completely destroy the Amalekites for what they did to them on their journey through the desert.
Deu.26	Instructions for the offering of the firstfruits. Obey all of God's commands.
Deu.27	On Mount <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5858B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5858B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5858B' clickHandler>Ebal</jLink></jLink></jLink>, take large stones, cover them with plaster, and write all the laws there.

The Levites will say: Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol-a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of the craftsman's hands-and sets it up in secret. Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother. Cursed is the man who moves his neighbor's boundary stone. Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the road. Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow. Cursed is the man who sleeps with his father's wife, for he dishonors his father's bed. Cursed is the man who has sexual relations with any animal. Cursed is the man who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. Cursed is the man who sleeps with his mother-in-law. Cursed is the man who kills his neighbor secretly. Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out.
Deu.28	If you obey all of the laws, God will bless you. It lists the blessings for obeying. It lists the curses for not obeying; curses that will completely destroy the Israelites. One of the curses is a raining of dust. One of the curses is cannibalism of their own children. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> says all of these curses will come to pass if they do not obey God's laws.
Deu.29	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells them that the Israelites are now making a covenant with God, and all of the curses will come to pass if they break the covenant. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> recounts the many things they have seen from God. If the covenant is broken, the whole Promised Land will become a burning waste of salt and sulfur-nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it.
Deu.30	If, after the blessings and the curses come upon the Israelites and they are few and scattered, the Israelites again believe and follow God in all his laws, God will gather them back to the Promised Land where they will prosper. Their enemies will then get the curses that plagued the Israelites. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> pleads that the Israelites chose the path of blessings.

Every 7 years the laws of God must be read during the Feast of Tabernacles for all to hear. God meets with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the Tent of Meeting as a pillar of cloud. God says the people, soon after entering the Promised Land, will rebel and worship other gods, and so God will apply curses to them. God said to take the laws that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> is writing down and place them beside the Ark of the Covenant as a witness against the people.

The 12 did this to serve as a reminder. 40,000 armed men from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7205' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7205' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7205' clickHandler>Reuben</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1410G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1410G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1410G' clickHandler>Gad</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and the half-tribe of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4519G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4519G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4519G' clickHandler>Manasseh</jLink></jLink></jLink> crossed the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler>Jordan</jLink></jLink></jLink> in front of the other Israelites.

The party encamped there until everyone was healed from the circumcisions, and took Passover there. They also ate produce from the land of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler>Canaan</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Jos.6	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> how to wage psychological warfare on the city of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3405G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3405G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3405G' clickHandler>Jericho</jLink></jLink></jLink>, which was now closed up due to the Israelites' proximity. For 6 days, all the armed men matched once around the city, followed by the priests carrying the Ark, while 7 priests blew 7 trumpets. On the seventh day, the same group marched 7 times around the city. For the 7th march, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> gave the instructions for the men to shout, for the wall will collapse, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7343' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7343' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7343' clickHandler>Rahab</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s household should be spared, and all gold, silver, bronze, and iron spoils belong to God, and they should stay away from “devoted things”, things that should be destroyed for God. The men shouted. The wall collapsed. The men killed every living thing in the city, including the livestock, with the exception of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7343' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7343' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7343' clickHandler>Rahab</jLink></jLink></jLink> and her family for saving the spies. The metal spoils were put in God's treasury. Then the city was burned. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> cursed anyone who would rebuild <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3405G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3405G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3405G' clickHandler>Jericho</jLink></jLink></jLink>, saying it will cost that man his first born and his youngest son.

The Manassites were not able to occupy all the towns in their allotment because the Canaanites “were determined to live in that region”. When the Israelites got stronger, they forced the Canaanites into slave labor, but could not drive them out completely. They said that one of the reasons they couldn't beat the Canaanites is that they all had iron chariots. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3130G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3130G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3130G' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink> reassures them that they can drive out the Canaanites.

Jdg.2	God, in angel form, tells the Israelites that since they made covenants with some of the people in the Promised Land, and since the Israelites didn't break down their altars, God will not drive the people out before the Israelites and they will remain as thorns in the Israelites' sides. This occurred at Bokim. The generation after <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091G' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> knew not God or what He did for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. They broke God's covenant and worshiped Baals and other pagan gods. God was angry and sent raiders to defeat them. Then God raised up judges (leaders) to save them from the raiders, because God had compassion on the Israelites for their suffering. The Israelites continued their disobedience to God despite the judges, and become more corrupt after each judge dies. God leaves the people of the Promised Land among the Israelites to test them.

Jdg.6	The Israelites turned to evil ways again, so God give them to the Midianites for 7 years. The Israelites hid in caves because of the oppression. The Midianites ruined their crops and killed all their livestock. The Midianites came in numbers impossible to count. The Israelites cry to God for help. God sent them a prophet that said the Israelites worshiped pagan gods. The Angel of God appeared to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> and said that God is with him.

God helps whittle the troops down to just 300, those that lapped water like dogs, while 31,700 left to go back home. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> to attack the Midianite camp, but if he is afraid, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his servant should go down and listen to the camp. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his servant go to the camp and overhear a dream prophesy that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> will take the camp.

For his leadership, the Israelites want <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> to rule. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> says he will not rule the Israelites, God will do that. But he will take a reward of gold earrings. Talking the reward, he makes an ephod out of it. All Israelites worship the ephod. There was peace for 40 years. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1439' clickHandler>Gideon</jLink></jLink></jLink> had 70 sons with his many wives and concubines.

The Danites were wandering around looking for their inheritance land. Some Danite spies came across <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler>Micah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s house and spent the night there. The spies recognized the Levite and asked him if their journey would be successful, to which the Levite said God approved their journey. The spies continued and found a city and land ripe for the taking, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3889' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3889' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3889' clickHandler>Laish</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

They stopped by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler>Micah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s house, stole his instruments of worship including the idol and carved image, and convinced the Levite to come with them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318G' clickHandler>Micah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and some men caught up with the Danites, but realized there was nothing he could do about the theft if he wanted to keep his life. The Danites attacked the peaceful and unsuspecting city of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3889' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3889' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3889' clickHandler>Laish</jLink></jLink></jLink>, burning it to the ground.

A Levite took a concubine from Bethlehem. She was unfaithful and returned to her father. Four months later the Levite went to her father's house. The father persuaded the Levite to stay longer than he intended, but then finally left in the afternoon one day toward Jebus (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>). As nightfall approached, they passed up a Jebusite city in favor of an Israelite city that they reached later, Gibeah. They waited in the town square for some time, but no one invited them to rest at their house. An old man finally invited them into his home for the night. Wicked men of the city began to surround the old man's house, demanding that he send the Levite out so they could have sex with him. Instead, the old man offers his virgin daughter and the Levite's concubine. They ignore the old man so he takes the Levite's concubine and sends her outside. The men raped and abused her through the night. When they were done with her, she went back to the old man's house and fell down at the door. The Levite opened the door in the morning and told her it was time to go, but there was no answer. The Levite puts her on his donkey and heads home. Upon reaching home, he cuts up his concubine into 12 pieces and sends them to all areas of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The people that saw it were shocked and looking for guidance.
Jdg.20	In reaction to the 12 concubine pieces prompted all the Israelites from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1835H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1835H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1835H' clickHandler>Dan</jLink></jLink></jLink> to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0884' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0884' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0884' clickHandler>Beersheba</jLink></jLink></jLink> (except the Benjamites) to gather in Mitpah, including 400,000 armed soldiers. They questioned the Levite how this had happened. The Levite tells an altered and incomplete story, that the Gibeah people wanted to kill him, not have sex with him. After the telling, all the people rose “as one man” and said they will bring the city of Gibeah to justice, by attacking it of course. The assembled Israelites demand the Benjamites to give up the evil people of Gibeah, but they prepare to guard Gibeah instead with 26,000 swordsmen and 700 highly accurate, left-handed stone slingers. The Israelites ask God who should attack first, to which God replies <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The first day of battle, 22,000 Israelites are slain. The Israelites ask God should they continue the battle, and God says yes. This results in 18,000 more Israelites being slain. All the remaining Israelites then went to Bethel, fasted, and made offerings. They asked God if they should attack again. God says yes, and this time He will deliver them into their hands. This time the Israelites actually used tactics to fight, setting up an ambush for Gibeah for when another line of soldiers lured the Benjamite warriors from their position. When the Benjamites had killed 30 Israelites, they claimed they were beating the Israelites as before. Gibeah was put to the sword and burned. The smoke signaled the counter-attack that would kill most of the Benjamite warriors. 600 Benjamites fled to the rock of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7417B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7417B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7417B' clickHandler>Rimmon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, while all the rest were killed. The Israelites pressed on and put to the sword all the other towns of the Benjamites.
Jdg.21	The Israelites grieved that the Benjamites were nearly wiped out. The Israelites made a vow that anyone that didn't show up for this battle should be killed. They realized the 600 remaining Benjamites did not have wives left, so the tribe would die out without women. But they had made a vow that none of the Israelites at the battle should give their daughters to a Benjamite for a wife, or they would be cursed. Well, they realized the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3003H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3003H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3003H' clickHandler>Jabesh</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1568G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1568G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1568G' clickHandler>Gilead</jLink></jLink></jLink> had not attended the battle, so they had to be killed. The Israelites decided and carried out a plan to kill everyone but the virgins from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3003H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3003H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3003H' clickHandler>Jabesh</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1568G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1568G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1568G' clickHandler>Gilead</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and marry the virgins to the Benjamites. But there were only 400 virgins, so 200 Benjamites remained without wives. They let the 200 spouse-less Benjamites ambush some dancing women during a festival to God in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler>Shiloh</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

1Sa.5	The Philistines take the Ark to Dagon's temple in Ashod. Two mornings in a row, Dagon had fallen on his face in front of the Ark, with his hands and feet removed on the second day. God causes destruction and tumors in Ashod to the point where the Philistines decide to move the Ark. Death and tumors followed the Ark, and the cries of nearby denizens “went up to heaven”.
1Sa.6	After 7 months of death and tumors, the Philistines decide to get rid of the Ark. Under their priests' advice, they sent the Ark away with an offering of gold tumors and gold rats on a cart pulled by cows. Since the cows didn't veer in their course, they knew that it was the God of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> causing their problems.

The people mourned this death. The people of Beth Shemesh ask the people of Kiriath Jearim to take the Ark.

1Ki.12	The Israelites plea to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler>Rehoboam</jLink></jLink></jLink> to make their work easier, because it was hard under <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Against the advice of the elders, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler>Rehoboam</jLink></jLink></jLink> says he will make the work even more difficult and demanding. Due to this treatment, only the people of Judah remained loyal to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler>Rehoboam</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The rest of the Israelites made Jeraboam their king. This fulfilled God's plan to take the kingdom away from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler>Rehoboam</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler>Rehoboam</jLink></jLink></jLink> rallied the people of Judah and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1144G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1144G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1144G' clickHandler>Benjamin</jLink></jLink></jLink> to regain the kingdom, but God spoke through his prophet <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8098A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8098A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8098A' clickHandler>Shemaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and convinced the people not to fight because this was fulfilling God's plan. Jeraboam thinks that if the Israelites worship their God, they will turn again to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7346' clickHandler>Rehoboam</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> he makes Golden Bulls for them to worship, claiming that they were the gods that brought them out of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Jeraboam also set up altars, sacrifices, and festivals to these gods. The Israelites worshiped the Golden Bulls.
1Ki.13	A man of God came from Judah to Bethel to an altar where Jeraboam was and proclaimed that a Davidic child by the name of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler>Josiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> will sacrifice those that now make offerings at that altar, and proclaimed the altar will be split in two and ashes will be poured on it. When Jeraboam points to the man and directs people to seize him, Jeraboam's hand withers and the altar cracks in two as the man said it would. Jeraboam has the man pray to God to restore the hand, and God does this. Jeraboam invites the man home for dinner, but the man refuses saying God told him not to eat or drink on this journey, and to go home a different way than he arrived there. A prophet from Bethel hears about the altar affair and finds the man of God and invites him back for dinner. The Bethel prophet tells a lie that an angel told him he should feed the man of God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> the man of God went with the prophet. “The word of the LORD came out of” the Bethel prophet and told the man that since he disobeyed, he will not be buried in the tomb of his fathers. When the man left to return home, a lion attacked and killed him, and then stood by the body. The Bethel prophet claims the body of the man and buries him in Bethel. Jeraboam continued being evil, and consecrated anyone that wanted to be a priest. This sin led to the house Jeraboam being destroyed from the face of the earth.
1Ki.14	Jeraboam's son Abijah becomes ill, so he sends his wife to the prophet <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler>Ahijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to determine what will happen. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler>Ahijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells Jeraboam's wife that God is angry because Jeraboam did not act like <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink>, “who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes”. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0281H' clickHandler>Ahijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> says God will utterly destroy the house of Jeraboam and uproot and scatter the Israelites across the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler>Euphrates</jLink></jLink></jLink> river, and Abijah will die when she returns.

The doubting officer was placed in the gateway by God so that he was trampled to death by the Israelites as they went out to plunder. Thus what God had said would happen did happen.

Ezr.1	In the 1st year of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink> reign as king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler>Persia</jLink></jLink></jLink>, he proclaims that God gave him “all the kingdoms” on earth and has told him to build the Temple of God in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and that the Israelites should be allowed to go back and rebuild the Temple, and encouraged offerings for the Temple, fulfilling the prophesy of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Ezr.2	This lists family lineage counts of the exiled Israelites that returned to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. There were some that returned that could not show proof of their lineage, so they were considered unclean. There were 42360 people, 7337 slaves, and 200 singers. They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys. Donations were taken for the repair work. Everyone went back to their original towns.
Ezr.3	The head priest, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3442J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3442J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3442J' clickHandler>Jeshua</jLink></jLink></jLink>, built the altar of God.

Upon laying the foundation, they gave praise to God that “His love to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>” is forever. The elders that had seen the former Temple wept at the new foundation.
Ezr.4	Enemies of Judah worked to discourage the building of the Temple, and to frustrate the plans.

There were no Levites among them, so Ezra borrowed some Levites from nearby towns. Before setting out to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, Ezra conducted a fast and asked for God's help to keep them safe.

All of these were burnt offerings.
Ezr.9	The Jewish leaders tell Ezra that the people, including the Levites and the priests, have not kept themselves separate, so they have “mingled the holy race” with non-Jewish people. Ezra was appalled. In the evening, Ezra prays to God saying that God punished their forefathers for their sins, and now this Jewish remnant is sinning with intermarriage.

The king asked what he wanted, to which Nehemiah replied that he wanted to go rebuild the city, and that he needed to granted safe passage as well as timber from the king's forest. The king agreed to this, sending an army and cavalry with him.

Nehemiah arranged for half of the Jews to be armed and on guard while the other half continued with the repairs, and had those doing the repairs equipped with weapons.
Neh.5	Many Jews were having to borrow and mortgage from other Jews to survive the famine, and the lenders were charging usury. Nehemiah heard of this, got angry, and commanded that the lenders give back the usury and the properties belonging to the poorer Jews. During the 12 years of Nehemiah being governor of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, he did not take any governor's pay.

The city was spacious compared to the number of people. The houses had not yet been rebuilt. This lists family lineage counts of the exiled Israelites that returned to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. There were some that returned that could not show proof of their lineage, so they were considered unclean. There were 42360 people, 7337 slaves, and 200 singers. They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys. Donations were taken for the repair work. Everyone went back to their original towns.
Neh.8	All the Jews assembled in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler>Ezra</jLink></jLink></jLink> to read them the Book of the Law. The Levites helped make the Law clear and give it meaning so people could understand it. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5166H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5166H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5166H' clickHandler>Nehemiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler>Ezra</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and the Levites told the people to stop grieving over the Law, because this was a sacred day. The people made booths of olive tree branches per the law for the Feast of Tabernacles in Leviticus 23. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5830G' clickHandler>Ezra</jLink></jLink></jLink> read from the Law each of the 7 days of the Feast.
Neh.9	Later that month, the Israelites repented and fasted. They separated themselves from all foreigners. They spent a quarter of the day reading the Law, and a quarter of their day confessing their sins and in worship. The Levites pray to God, who is forgiving, gracious, merciful, compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in love. The prayer briefly recounts the history of the Jews from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> until then. A covenant with God was written and sealed by Levites and priests.
Neh.10	There is a list of the priests and Levites that sealed the written covenant. All the people take an oath to obey the Law, including bringing the firstborn sons and the firstborn of the cattle and flocks to the priests. Everything will be done according to the Law.
Neh.11	The Jewish leaders settled in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Everyone else lived in their original towns. Then there is a list of those that settled in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and a brief description of the settlements outside of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Neh.12	There is a list of the priests and Levites that returned to Judah with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Large amounts of sacrifices were made, and the people rejoiced loudly. Men were appointed to administer the collection, storage, and distribution of the tithes.
Neh.13	After Nehemiah had returned to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0783A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0783A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0783A' clickHandler>Artaxerxes</jLink></jLink></jLink>, he requested a return visit to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The king granted this visit. Upon arrival, the Law was read, and the people heard how no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be allowed into the assembly of God, so they removed all people of foreign descent from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Nehemiah also learned that the Levites and singers had been neglected in tithes, so he reestablished the tithes. Nehemiah also found that men of Judah were working on the Sabbath, and merchants were selling merchandise on the Sabbath. He rebuked them and stopped that sinful practice. Nehemiah also found some men of Judah had interracial marriages, and he rebuked and punished them for it.
Est.1	In 3rd year of Xerxes rule of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler>Persia</jLink></jLink></jLink>, he held a banquet for the upper class. He had displayed his wealth for 180 days, and then he held the banquet for 7 days.

Est.2	Xerxes rounds up into his harem the most beautiful virgins throughout his kingdom for a contest where the one that best pleases the king will become the queen. A Jewish woman by the name of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0635' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0635' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0635' clickHandler>Esther</jLink></jLink></jLink> pleased the eunuch in charge of the harem, so he gave her a prominent position there. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0635' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0635' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0635' clickHandler>Esther</jLink></jLink></jLink> kept hid that she was Jewish. Each of the harem girls spent a year getting beauty treatments before meeting with Xerxes. Then each one would spend one night with Xerxes, and would not return unless he asked for her by name.

Psa.1	The Two Ways: Contrasts the way of the righteous with the way of the wicked. It begins by describing the blessed person who does not follow the advice of the wicked, stand in the way of sinners, or sit in the company of mockers.

In contrast, the wicked are likened to chaff that is blown away by the wind. Ultimately, the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.

The chapter begins with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0094' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0094' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0094' clickHandler>Agur</jLink></jLink></jLink> admitting that he is not as wise as he should be and that he seeks understanding from God.

Ecc.1	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> talks about how life is meaningless. He says that generations come and go, and men are forgotten, meanwhile the earth remains forever and continues through its natural cycles. He claims that there is nothing new under the sun, and that what is thought to be new turns out to be old. He has devoted himself to the study of wisdom only to find it to be meaningless, like chasing the wind. More knowledge only brings more grief.
Ecc.2	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> decided to turn to pleasures. He accomplished many projects, amassed great wealth, and experienced any physical pleasure that he desired. However, he ultimately found this to be meaningless as well. He reasons that wisdom is better than foolishness, just like light is better than darkness, but finds them both to be meaningless in the end. Both the fool and the wise man will die and be forgotten. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> he began to hate his possessions and the products of his hard toil, because these things would just be inherited by his successor, who had not worked for them and may be a fool. The best a man can do is enjoy his food, his drink, and his work. God grants wisdom, knowledge, and happiness to those that please Him, but to the sinner He makes them toil for wealth just to hand it over to someone God chooses.
Ecc.3	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> says that there is a proper time for everything. God has given man the ability to think about eternity, yet they can't fathom all that God has done. The best a man can do while they live is to be happy and do good. The enjoyment of food, drink, and work is available to all and is a gift of God. What God does endures forever without change so that men will revere him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> saw wickedness in the places of judgement and justice, so he thought to himself God would judge both the righteous and the wicked according to His timing. Man can see that they share the same fate as animals; death. Nobody knows if a man's spirit goes up to Heaven. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> concludes that the best a man can do is enjoy his work, because he doesn't know what happens after he dies.
Ecc.4	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> sees how people are oppressed and claims that the dead are better off, and the yet-to-be-born are even better than the dead because they haven't seen evil. All achievement comes from envy. It's better to be poor and peaceful than rich in meaningless pursuits. A lonely man's work is meaningless and risky. Even if a prisoner or poor man becomes a king, he will be forgotten in time, making his achievement meaningless.
Ecc.5	Listen to God and sacrifice with a purpose. Speak with few words. Respect any vows you make to God or else God will destroy the work of your hands. Fear God. Don't be surprised to see injustice and oppression when there is a corrupt king. Whoever loves money will never be satisfied with what they have. Possessions only please the eyes. A poor worker sleeps better than a wealthy man. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> has seen hoarded wealth harm its owner, and seen collected wealth lost, leaving no inheritance. A man is born with nothing and dies with nothing, making the product of his labor meaningless. The best a man can do is enjoy his food, his drink, and his work in the few days God has given him. When God gives a gift to a man of wealth and possessions and the ability to enjoy them, he should be happy with what he has. Such a man doesn't reflect regretfully on his life, because God keeps him occupied with gladness.
Ecc.6	It is evil when God gives a man wealth, possessions, and honor only to have God give those gifts to a stranger to enjoy. No matter how prosperous a man is during his life, if he does not have enjoyment in his final days and a proper burial, than his life is meaningless and a stillborn child is better off than he is. All people go to the same place. A man's appetite is never satisfied. The wise are no better off than the fools. It's better just to observe than to have desires. Everything has been named and known. A weak man can't fight a strong one. The more words, the less meaning. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> asks “who knows what is good for a man in life” when he can't tell what will happen on earth after he dies.
Ecc.7	A good name is valuable. Death is better than birth. Sorrow is better than laughter, and sorrow is good for the heart. Mourning and sadness is better than pleasure. It's better to be rebuked than to listen to fools. Extortion and bribery corrupt a person. The end is better than the beginning. Patience is better than pride. Fools are quick to anger. It's not wise to compare the joy of previous days to present ones. Wisdom, like money, is a shelter, and preserves the owner of it. You can't change God's plans. God makes both the good times and the bad. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> has seen a righteous man die for his righteousness and has seen a wicked man live a long life. Therefore, he recommends not being overly righteous, wise, wicked, or foolish, but instead he recommends to use moderation in all of these. A wise man is powerful. Even righteous men sin. Don't have hypocritical standards. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> devoted himself to understand wisdom (meaning God's plans for all that is going on) but could not. He finds deceitful, seductive women worse than death, and only men that please God could escape such women, meanwhile sinners get ensnared by such women. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> found one righteous man out of one thousand men, but no righteous women at all. God made men righteous, but men began scheming.
Ecc.8	A wise man is different than others in his demeanor. Yield to the king's supreme power. No man knows the future or the time of his death. Wickedness will not release those that practice wicked behavior. The wicked lords will die too. Untimely justice encourages sin. God will treat God-fearing men better than wicked men. Sometimes, without meaning, the righteous get the reward of the wicked and the wicked get the reward of the righteous. The best a man can do is enjoy his food, his drink, and be happy in the few days God has given him. No one can understand God's plans.
Ecc.9	The righteous and the wise are in God's hands and God will do as he pleases. The righteous and the evil both will die. Having the same destiny for both the righteous and the evil is evil. The living know they will die. The dead know nothing and have no further reward. The dead are forgotten. Eat and drink wine and be happy, because it is now that God favors you. Enjoy your wife and your work all of your meaningless days, because there is nothing for you after you die. Timing and chance play a large role in outcomes. Nobody knows when they will die. The wise can overpower kings, even though they will be forgotten.
Ecc.10	A little bit of foolishness can ruin everything. Stay in your post if the ruler is angry with you. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> has seen evil rulers appoint fools to high places and the rich to low places. There are hazards associated with what you do. Skill and strength can make use of a dull ax. A snake that bites the charmer provides no profit for the charmer. The wise are gracious, while fools condemn themselves with their words. Woe to lands ruled by former children or servants, whose princes feast in the morning. Blessed are lands ruled by kings of noble birth, whose princes feast at proper times. A lazy man lets his house deteriorate. A feast is for laughing and wine is for happiness, “but money is the answer for everything.” Be careful about what you say.
Ecc.11	Be generous and you will find generosity returned to you. Give to many, because you don't know the future. What will happen will happen. Do what needs to be done when it needs to be done despite the surrounding circumstances. Nobody can understand God's plans. Work at several different things to ensure your success. Enjoy your meaningless life, but know that God will judge you. Banish anxiety, because it's all meaningless.
Ecc.12	Remember God before you become cynical and die. When you die, you will become dust again and your spirit will return to God. Everything is meaningless. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> was a wise teacher who wrote down many proverbs. His words were perfect and righteous. Keep the commandments of God, for God will judge every deed.

She then goes on to talk about renting vineyards. Her lover calls for her, and she calls for him to go away with her.

Stop bringing meaningless sacrifices. God hates their festivals, Sabbaths, and appointed feasts. God will not listen to your prayers. Purify yourself, be righteous, seek justice, and defend the oppressed, orphans, and widows. Though the Israelites are stained with scarlet sins, they will be purified white as snow again and be rewarded if they obey God. But if they don't obey, they will be killed by the sword. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> has become a whore, and everything has been corrupted.

Hide from the wrath of God. God has a day planned when all arrogant men will be humbled and God alone will be exalted. Idols will disappear on that day. On that day, men will throw away their idols and try to hide from God's wrath. Stop trusting in man.
Isa.3	God is about to remove all food, water, and leaders from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah. Children will lead and govern. Neighbors will fight each other. No one will want to rule. This will happen because they have been proud of their sins. The righteous will be rewarded at that time. God will punish the elders and the leaders for creating this evil and oppressing the poor. The Israelite women act and dress seductively, so God will give them sores and make them bald. God will take all of their jewelery. God will make them stinky, bald, branded, and poorly dressed. Men will die in battle.
Isa.4	In that day, women will be so desperate for marriage that seven women will marry one man only for his namesake. The survivors will inherit a beautiful and glorious land and will be called holy after God has purged and cleansed <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> with a spirit of judgement and a spirit of fire. Then God will make a canopy of smoke by day and fire by night to protect the land.
Isa.5	In a vineyard metaphor, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> says that God set up <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the best country using the best people to start things off. However, the result has been bad, so God will destroy it. God will punish wealthy landowners by making their crop production drop. Woe to the drunkards. The Israelites have parties without respect to God, so they will be sent into exile and many will die in the process. Mankind will be humbled, God will be exalted by His justice, and sheep will feed in the ruins. Woe to those that seek a quick resolution of God's plan, to those that deceive, to the arrogant wise, to drunkards, to those that take bribes and deny justice. God will punish the Israelites with deadly earthquakes until bodies litter the streets, and He has called other nations to attack them, and these nations are on their way. God will see to it that the other nations are successful in attacking the Israelites.
Isa.6	In the year that King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5818G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5818G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5818G' clickHandler>Uzziah</jLink></jLink></jLink> died, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> had a vision of God on a throne in a temple with six-winged seraphs flying above Him. They hid their faces with two wings, hid their feet with two wings, and flew with the last pair of wings. They praised God, and the Temple filled with smoke. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> feared that he was guilty, but a seraph touched <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s mouth with a hot coal and told him that his guilt was taken away and his sin was atoned. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell the Israelites to hear but not understand, see but not perceive, make them calloused and stubborn so that they will not change their minds and thus be healed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked how long should this happen. God replies until the land is destroyed, but a tenth of the population will remain there and as a holy seed.
Isa.7	When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler>Ahaz</jLink></jLink></jLink> was king of Judah, Aram allied with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to attack Judah. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler>Ahaz</jLink></jLink></jLink> that Aram and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will not be successful in conquering Judah. God (implicitly) tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to ask <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler>Ahaz</jLink></jLink></jLink> what sign he would like from God as proof that he will not be conquered. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler>Ahaz</jLink></jLink></jLink> rejects the question, not wanting to test God. (Implicitly) God angrily responds through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler>Ahaz</jLink></jLink></jLink> is trying God's patience, and God will give them a sign: that a virgin (literally “a young woman”) will give birth to a son called Immanuel (God with us). Immanuel will eat curds and honey until he knows right from wrong. But before the boy is that mature, the two attacking kings will be laid to waste. God will then bring the king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink> to invade Judah. God will fill the land with Egyptian flies and Assyrian bees. The Assyrian king will shave them. Cows and goats will produce a lot of milk, so the people will eat curds and honey. God will fill the vineyards and fields with briers and thorns so that they will be afraid to farm there.
Isa.8	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to write on a scroll “quick to the plunder swift to the spoils”. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> has sex with a prophetess who bears a son, and God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to name him quick to the plunder swift to the spoils, and that before the boy can talk <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler>Damascus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be plundered by the king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to fear and dread Him, and He will be a Sanctuary. But for the Israelites, God will be a stone that trips them and a snare that traps them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> says that he will trust God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> says that those who do not consult with God will see only distress, darkness, and gloom.

People in darkness have seen a great light. You (which is not defined as to who this is) have made the nation bigger, increased joy, and lifted peoples burdens. War-bloodied clothing will be burnt. A son is born who will rule and be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His peace and government will know no end, and he will rule from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s throne in justice and righteousness forever.

God will not pity orphans or widows because everybody in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> is wicked. God will scorch the land, incite brother to fight against brother, and bring them to cannibalism.
Isa.10	Woe to the unjust and the oppressors, they will see a day of reckoning where they will cower or die. Woe to the king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God sent him to conquer Judah, but he will be punished for thinking that it is through his strength that he has done this. God will punish his soldiers with disease, and the “Light of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>” will destroy his nation in a single day. In that day, the Israelite remnants will return to Mighty God. God tells the remnant that very soon His wrath will end against them and will turn to the Assyrians and will destroy them.

He will be righteous and wise, have delight in and fear of God, and will speak condemning, righteous justice. Weak animals will live peacefully with strong animals, and carnivores will become vegetarians. All the earth will know God. All nations will rally behind this “root of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3448' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3448' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3448' clickHandler>Jesse</jLink></jLink></jLink>”, and God will gather the remnant Israelites back from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3568A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3568A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3568A' clickHandler>Cush</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5867A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5867A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5867A' clickHandler>Elam</jLink></jLink></jLink>, Baylonia, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler>Hamath</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the islands, and all the earth.

They will attack on the day of God to enact His wrath. People will be terrorized and writhe in pain. The day of God will be cruel with wrath and anger, destroying sinners. There will be no light from the stars, the sun, or the moon. God will punish the world for their wicked sins and put an end to haughty arrogance and ruthless pride. Afterwards, mankind's population will be scarce. Heaven and earth will shake. People will flee to their homelands. Anyone caught will be killed, their children will be killed, and their wives will be raped. God will send the Medes to make this merciless attack on <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> will never again be inhabited except by wild animals.

Slaughter the king's sons for the sins of their forefathers so that they will have no inheritance. God will utterly destroy Babylonian nation and turn it into an owl-filled swamp. God, according to His plan for the whole world, will crush the Assyrians for oppressing his people, and nobody can stop Him.

Everyone on earth will see God's banner raised in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and will hear His trumpet. The Cushites will be mostly destroyed, and then they will give tribute to God in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Isa.19	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> gets a prophecy that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be destroyed. God will make the Egyptians fight amongst themselves, make all their plans fail, be ruled by a fiercely cruel king, and experience a drought so bad that the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2975G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2975G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2975G' clickHandler>Nile</jLink></jLink></jLink> will dry up and all of the crops will be destroyed. Additionally God will make all of the Egyptian leaders and wise men fools. The Egyptians will cower like women at the mention of Judah because of what God has planned for them. At that time five Egyptian cities will speak the Canaanite language and swear allegiance to God. At that time there will be an altar to God put in the heart of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> and a monument to God put at its border. When the Egyptians cry out to God, He will send them a Savior. The Egyptians will sacrifice to God. God will attack them with a plague and then heal them. At that time, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and the Assyrians will all worship God together and be a blessing to the earth.

Isa.22	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> gets a prophecy about <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the Valley of Vision. God is wondering why there is so much commotion when they were captured without bloodshed and their leaders were taken away. God has a day of terror planned for <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> brought on by the Elamites and the Medes. The Israelites changed <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the process of trying to rebuild its defences without consideration that God had designed <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God had made <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> to become captured to provoke repentance, but instead the Israelites had a party because they thought they would die the next day. For as long as they live this sin will not be atoned for. The king's steward, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7644' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7644' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7644' clickHandler>Shebna</jLink></jLink></jLink>, is going to be sent to a foreign country and disgraced. God will make <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0471G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0471G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0471G' clickHandler>Eliakim</jLink></jLink></jLink>, son of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2518G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2518G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2518G' clickHandler>Hilkiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, take <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7644' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7644' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7644' clickHandler>Shebna</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s place and give him great honor and athority. What <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0471G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0471G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0471G' clickHandler>Eliakim</jLink></jLink></jLink> opens, nobody can shut, and what he shuts nobody can open.
Isa.23	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> gets a prophecy that <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be destroyed. Everyone will be amazed at its destruction. This is part of God's plan to humble all renowned men. The destruction will spread to all of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G5403' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G5403' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G5403' clickHandler>Phoenicia</jLink></jLink></jLink>, just like what happened to the Babylonians. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink> will remained destroyed for seventy years. Then it will be like a prostitute to all nations, and all of it's profits will be given to God's people.
Isa.24	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> gets a prophecy that all of the earth will be destroyed, its surface will be ruined and people will be scattered. The earth will be completely plundered and dry up. Because people defile the earth by breaking laws and “the everlasting covenant”, God will curse the earth, burning people until there is only a remnant left. Nobody will be cheerful or happy. The city will be ruined. The remnant will joyfully praise God. For the others, there will be no escape from God's wrath. The earth will fracture and shake violently, and mankind will never recover. At that time God will punish the mighty in Heaven and on earth, binding them in prison and punishing them for many days, and God will rule the earth gloriously from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Isa.25	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> praises God for doing what He had planned. God destroyed fortified cities. Because God showed His power, all people will honor God. In <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> God will prepare a feast for everybody, with the best meat and wine. From <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, God will set up a one world government. God will end death forever, stop people from crying, and make the Israelites proud again. The Israelites which trusted God will rejoice in His salvation. But God will destroy the Moabites.
Isa.26	At that time people in Judah will sing a song saying: <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> is fortified by God's salvation. Trust in God and have peace. God humbles mighty men. We follow God's laws and seek Him. People learn righteousness when God judges the earth, but the wicked do not learn their lesson. Let God's fire burn the wicked. We don't honor our past kings, we only honor God as our king. The dead kings are punished and wiped from our memory. God has made His/our nation become (or instead “become honored in” according to a more literal interpretation) the whole world. We have worked in pain like a pregnant woman, but have have not really produced anything substantial, such as salvation or life. (As best as I can discern studying the different translations of the Bible, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> 26:19-21 could be interpreted essentially two different ways. Both are included here, numbered 1 and 2. I favor 1 because of how the reanimated dead are supposed to shout for joy [in the sense that the sins against them will finally be punished] and the earth is supposed to be a witness of their blood, but most scholars probably favor 2 because of the closer tie in with the final judgement of Christian theology.) {1} We should hide indoors for a little while, because God will resurrect those which had their blood wrongfully shed and take vengeance on those of whom are responsible. {2} All of the dead will live again. We should hide indoors for a little while, because God will unleash His wrath on all of the sinners.
Isa.27	At that time, God will punish with His sword. He will slay Leviathan, a sea monster. In a garden metaphor, God stewards and guards the Israelites. God will battle enemies but will accept the peaceful in peace. The Israelites will fill the earth with their fruit. God has punished the Israelites, but not as severely as He has punished those people which attacked the Israelites. The Israelites' sin will be removed when all of the idol altars are destroyed and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> is abandoned and destroyed. God will show them no mercy because they do not obey Him. At that time, God will gather the exiled Israelites and return them to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> where they will worship God.
Isa.28	God will punish the Israelites which broke off from Judah, symbolized as Ephriam. At that time, God will be glorious to His remnant of people. Ephriam's priests are corrupt and distort God's teachings. Therefore God will have foreigners speak to the people because they would not listen to Him. God will let them continue in their evil so that they will be ensnared and punished. God tells the leaders of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who have made covenants with idols for protection, that He has set down the foundation of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> such that it will have justice and righteousness. Therefore, those which trust in idols will find no protection from the coming destruction. This is part of God's plan, just like you have to plow, sow, reap, and grind the grain to make bread.
Isa.29	God says that He will bring enemies to besiege <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and humble the city. Then, instantly God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s enemies with earthquakes, storms, and fire. The Israelites should be in awe by this. God has stopped giving the Israelites prophets and seers. Nobody will be able to interpret this prophesy. This is because the Israelites say they honor God but do not in their hearts, and they follow men's rules instead of God's rules. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God will humble the wise and intelligent. Nobody can hide what they do from God. Nobody has the right to question God. Shorty the known world will be changed. At that time the Israelites will understand this prophesy and will worship God. All of the evil people will be killed. The Israelites will be proud again, worshiping God in His awesomeness. Wayward people will then understand and follow God.
Isa.30	God is angry that Judah as made an alliance with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> without consulting God, and therefore will disgrace them by making the alliance ineffective. God calls <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> an arrogant do-nothing. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to write it down as witness forever. The Israelites will not follow God and choose not to listen to His prophets. Therefore, God will shatter their nation. God told them to rest and repent for salvation, that quietness and trust was their strength, but they would not listen. Instead they have chosen to flee, so God will scatter them until they are defenceless. But God wants to show them grace, and blessed are those that wait for God. When <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> cries for help, God will be quick to help them. God will guide them, and they will discard their idols. God will bless their crops and livestock. At that time they will have plentiful rivers and extra-bright daylight and moonlight. God is full of wrath, and He destroys nations and leads them astray. The Israelites will rejoice in God. Men will hear God's voice and see Him unleash His wrath in fire, thunderstorms, and hail. While making music, God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the valley of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8612' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8612' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8612' clickHandler>Topheth</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Isa.31	God is angry at the people of Judah for making an alliance with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> instead of seeking God's help. God will make both <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah fall. Like a brave lion, God will fight in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and protect it. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> pleads for the Israelites to return to God, and at that time they will reject their idols. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink> will fall by the sword of God, not of man, and their young men will become slaves.
Isa.32	God will make a righteous king rule. Then the people will be able to see and understand God clearly. Then the fools, and those which lie concerning God, and evil people will be exposed for what they are, but noble people will persevere. God tells the women that although they feel secure now, in a little more than a year God will bring about this Apocalypse, and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be laid to waste. This will continue until God sends His Spirit which will restore the land of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and provide peace and righteousness forever for the Israelites.
Isa.33	The destroyer will be destroyed and the betrayer will be betrayed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> asks God to be gracious to the Israelites. People flee from the voice of God. God will fill <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> with righteousness and will provide salvation if people fear Him. When people are distressed from the destruction of their cities, then God will appear and be exalted. Mankind has produced nothing worthwhile and they speak evil, so they will be burned. Those far away should take heed and those near God should acknowledge His power. God scares the Godless. Then the righteous will dwell in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> with God, where God will supply bread and water without fail. Those then in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will observe a beautiful king and vast nation, and will wonder what has become of the leaders from before the destruction. They will never again be ruled by foreigners. At that time <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be established forever, ruled by God, and full of wealth. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s inhabitants will never be sick and will be forgiven of their sins.
Isa.34	God is angry at all of the nations and will totally destroy them. The heavens will be rolled up like a scroll. After God destroys the heavens, He will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler>Edom</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Isa.35	The desert will become a glorious place. God will come with vengeance to save the Israelites. Then the blind will see, the deaf will hear, the lame will jump, and the mute will speak. At that time deserts will become lush lands. At that time there will be a highway called the “Way of Holiness”. Only holy people redeemed by God will be able to use the highway to return to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

However, the Assyrian army commander continued in Hebrew and spoke specifically to the other Israelites, telling them that they will have to eat and drink their own feces and urine if they don't surrender. He tells them not to believe what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler>Hezekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells them.

Like a shepherd, God gathers His sheep. Who is like God in His knowledge? The world is nothing compared to God. Idols are just man made objects which will not last. God sits above the circle of the earth and to him people are minuscule. At God's will, He destroys mighty men. God created the heavens by His power. God lasts forever; tireless and wiser than anyone. People who hope in God will be strengthened by Him and will not grow weary.
Isa.41	God tells the nations to strengthen themselves and then meet with God at the place of judgement. God talks of the creation of the nation of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> as a testimony of His power. The pagan nations support each other and think themselves to be strong. God tells the Israelites that He has gathered them from the ends of the earth, and not to fear because God is supporting them. God will humble those that speak against <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and will completely eliminate those that make war with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God will turn the Israelites into a vicious war machine which will utterly destroy their enemies, and the Israelites will praise God. God will make water flow for the thirsty, and will transform the desert into a fertile land so that people will know that the God of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> did this. God tells the pagan nations to bring their idols and prove their wisdom by explaining the past or predicting the future, and prove their power by some miraculous sign. The pagans are detestable and worthless. The pagans didn't foretell the future, but God gave <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> a messenger of good tidings. Not one pagan priest or idol has proved to be worthwhile.
Isa.42	God says that here is His chosen Servant who He will put His spirit on. The Servant will bring justice to the nations on earth, and will do so gently, without shouting in the streets, and will not falter. God has called His righteous Servant and will guide His Servant. God's Servant will be a covenant for the people and a guide for the Gentiles. The Servant will open the eyes of the blind and free prisoners and those in dungeons. God will not let anything else have His deserved glory. God is prophesying new things to come before they happen. Everyone should sing to God in praise and give Him glory. God will shout a battle cry and defeat His enemies. God has been quiet for a long time, but will now unleash His wrath. God will lead the blind through new territory and make their way easy, and will not forsake them. God will shame those who trust in idols. God tells the Israelites to understand Him. God asks who is blind other than His Servant and deaf like His messenger? The Israelites have not followed God. God wanted to make His Law glorious through the Israelites, but they are now in exiled captivity. God has put them into exile because they sinned against Him, yet they still didn't understand this punishment.
Isa.43	God tells the Israelites not to be afraid. God will protect them while they are in exile because God is their Savior, and will punish <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, Ethiopia, Sudan, and other men instead of the Israelites because God loves them. God will bring together all of the exiled Israelites again from wherever they are for His Glory. All of the nations will be assembled to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God claims that nobody else has prophesied this assembly. God tells the Israelites that they are His witnesses and His chosen Servant so that they would know that He is God. There are no other gods, and there is no other Savior. Nobody can counter God's actions. God, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s Redeemer and King, will destroy the Babylonians for the Israelites' sake. God, the orchestrator of the Exodus, tells the Israelites to forget the past. God is bringing about something new, and will change the desert wasteland into a lush region full of water. The wild animals will be happy with God for doing this. The Israelites, who God had formed to praise Him, will live in that lush land. However, because the Israelites have not provided proper service to God through sacrifices, but instead burden God with their sins, God will first punish and disgrace the Israelites.
Isa.44	God tells the Israelites, His Servant, not to be afraid because God will help them. God will bless the remnant of the Israelites with many descendants. They will proudly proclaim that they belong to God and will become known as <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God is <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s King and Redeemer, and the only true God. Nobody knows the past or can tell the future like God. Don't be afraid, because God told you this would happen. The various craftsmen which make idols and those which believe in idols don't understand anything and they are deluded. God tells the Israelites to remember that God made the Israelites and they are His Servant. God has absolved their sins, so they should return to Him and praise Him. God, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s Redeemer, the Creator of everything, the one that makes the ungodly people seem foolish but fulfills all of His prophesies, says that <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be inhabited and restored and the streams of the watery deep will dry up. God will accomplish this through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Isa.45	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink> that He will help him subdue nations, and will level mountains and break gates to make this happen. God will give <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink> the plunder and honor even though he doesn't acknowledge God for the sake of the Israelites and so that everybody will know God. God creates everything good and bad. God tells the heavens to rain down righteousness and tells the earth to let salvation spring up. God condemns those that question His plans. God will make <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink> rebuild <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and let the exiled Israelites free. The Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Sudanic people will pay tribute to the Israelites in honor of God. God hides Himself. Those that worship idols will be disgraced, but the Israelites will be saved with everlasting Salvation, never to be shamed or disgraced. God created earth to be inhabited. God did not speak in secret, He speaks the Truth. God tells the nations to gather together. Idol worshipers are ignorant. God asks them to say who has predicted the future, and claims that only God has done this. God is the only God and Savior. God tells the nations to turn to Him to be saved, and that God has sworn that every knee will bow to Him and acknowledge His righteousness. Those which fought against God will be put to shame, but the descendants of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be righteous.
Isa.46	The idols of pagan gods only provide burden for the weary, and they are hauled around at the whim of their owners. God tells the remnant of the Israelites to listen to Him, because He will sustain and rescue them. Who is God's equal? People are worshiping man-made idols which can't do anything for them. God says to remember that God alone is the only God, that He has made known “the end” from ancient times, and He will do whatever He pleases and has planned to do. God has chosen a man from the east to fulfill His plan. God's righteousness and Salvation for the Israelites is coming soon.
Isa.47	Although <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> believes that it is precious and flawless, God will expose their faults; taking His vengeance and not sparing one of them. God is the Redeemer, the Holy One of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God was angry with the Israelites, so He let the Babylonians capture them, but the Babylonians showed them no mercy. The Babylonians think that they are invincible, but God will bring them down. The sorcerers and astronomers they depend on will be of no help to prevent their downfall.
Isa.48	God tells the Israelites to listen. Many years ago God predicted the future and He took action to fulfill those prophesies. God knew that the Israelites were stubborn, so He gave these prophesies to prove that He is God. Now God will tell them about new things which God created now, not long ago. The Israelites have not understood or listened to God, but for God's own sake, He withholds His wrath. God has refined the Israelites through their afflictions. For God's own sake and glory He does this. God made the foundations of earth and spread out the heavens. What idol has predicted that the Babylonians will be destroyed? God tells the Israelites that if they had only listened to God, they would have lived in peace and righteousness, and would have had a large population. God will Redeem the Israelites and free them from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The Israelites did not thirst during the Exodus because God made water come from the rock. The wicked will have no peace.
Isa.49	God has made His sharp-speaking Servant, protected him, and chosen him to show God's glory. The Servant claims that he has labored in vain, but God will provide his reward. God made the Servant to gather the Israelites back to God, and God has been the Servant's strength. God will make His Servant not only gather the Israelites but also be a light to the Gentiles to bring Salvation to all of the earth. Although this Servant was despised and was a servant to rulers, God will make the Servant honored by kings and princes. When God chooses, He will make His Servant be a covenant and restore the exiled Israelites to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. They will not hunger, thirst, or be oppressed by the sun's heat. God will lead them to water and make their return easy from wherever they are. The Israelites cry that God has forsaken them, but God will never forget them. God will bring the Israelites back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and will bless them with so many offspring that they will need a larger country. The Gentiles will help bring Israelites back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and their royalty will humble themselves to the Israelites, and the Israelites will realize that God did this. God will rescue the Israelites, and make their oppressors eat their own flesh and drink their own blood. At that time, all of mankind will know God is <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s Savior and Redeemer.
Isa.50	God asks the Israelites if they thought God had left them or sold them, or if they thought He couldn't save them. God has the strength the rescue them because He is omnipotent. God has given His Servant the right words to say. God's Servant listens to God and doesn't rebel, and let his back be beat, his beard pulled out, and his face be spit on. The Servant knows that God will vindicate him soon. Those in darkness should follow God, because those which instead follow their man-made idols will be tormented.
Isa.51	God tells the Israelites to listen to Him, because He will rebuild <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and turn its deserts into gardens like Eden. God's law and justice will impress the Gentile nations. God's righteousness will soon come, and He will bring justice to the nations. The heavens will vanish, the earth will wear out, and people will die, but God's Salvation will last forever. God tells those with His Law in their hearts to listen (meaning the Israelites). The enemies of the Israelites will be destroyed but God's Salvation and righteousness will last through all generations. God's ransomed people will return to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> with everlasting joy. Why do the Israelites fear their oppressors when God will soon free them, including prisoners and those in dungeons? God is finished applying His wrath to the Israelites, and will now apply it to their oppressors.
Isa.52	The Israelites are to go free and to rebuild <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> in splendor because the uncircumcised and defiled will not enter there again. God sold the Israelites for free and now they will be redeemed without money. The Assyrians are acting like the pre-Exodus Egyptians, so God will punish them and prove that He is God. The Israelites should purify themselves and keep watch, because God will prepare the way for them to return to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Even though the appearance of God's Servant was pitiful, God's Servant will be exalted in a way such that kings and nations will see and understand God.
Isa.53	God's Servant was ugly, despised, and rejected, and the Israelites considered him afflicted by God. The Servant was pierced and crushed for the sin of the Israelites, but this punishment healed and brought peace to the Israelites. He did not protest his afflictions. He was “cut off from the land of the living” for the sin of the Israelites. He was given a grave with the wicked and the rich despite not being violent or deceitful. It was God's will to make him suffer to make his life a guilt offering. God will reward His Servant with offspring, prolonged life, and a large share of the spoils because he suffered so greatly, “pouring out his life unto death”, bearing the sin of many people and making intercession for them. Knowing him will justify many.
Isa.54	God, the Israelites' husband and Redeemer, God of all the earth, will restore the Israelites to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and they will be blessed with so many offspring that they will have to expand their boundaries into other countries, dispossessing other nations. They will not be shamed or humiliated, and will forget their earlier shame. In God's surge of anger, He briefly abandoned the Israelites. Now God is coming back to them with everlasting kindness and compassion. God swears that He will never rebuke them again, and His love and covenant of peace with them will last forever. God will rebuild <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> with precious stones. God will teach their sons. They will no longer have tyranny and terror. Anyone who attacks them will not succeed, and the attack will not be caused by God. God made the blacksmith and the destroyer. No weapon or accusations will harm the servants of God.
Isa.55	Come to drink and eat for free, and eat what is good to please your soul. Don't waste money on stuff that doesn't satisfy. Listen to God so that your soul will live. God has set <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to be a prosperous leader and commander of nations forever. Seek God while you can find Him. Repent and God will freely pardon you. God's thoughts and ways are not those of humans; they are much better. God will accomplish what He plans to do. Thorn bushes and briers will no longer grow as a sign of God's everlasting covenant.
Isa.56	God's Salvation will happen soon. Blessed is the man that acts justly and righteously and who keeps the Sabbath. Foreigners which obey God's Law and keep the Sabbath will be joyfully welcomed in the Temple, and their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted. God will gather others besides the exiled Israelites. The wild beasts will come and devour. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s leaders are wicked.
Isa.57	God kills the righteous to save them from the evil yet to come. The pagans mock God, fornicate, sacrifice their children, and give offerings to idols, so God will not withhold His wrath from them. The pagans have chosen their gods over God. Despite the fact that these gods have not helped them, they continue to worship them. Because the pagans don't respect God, He will destroy them. God will prepare the road back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God is with the contrite. God will not accuse in anger forever, because otherwise men would give up on God. God punished the Israelites, but they continued sinning. However, God will heal and guide the Israelites and they will praise God again. There will be no rest for the wicked.
Isa.58	God says to tell the Israelites that they rebel against Him. They are eager for God's guidance, and they fast and humble themselves, but they continue to disregard God's commandments. God's instructions of fasting are: free the oppressed, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, clothe the naked, and aid your family. If you fast like that, then God will heal, protect, help, guide, and strengthen you. If the Israelites fast like that, they will rebuild the ruins of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. If they obey the Sabbath properly and then God will restore <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the Israelites.
Isa.59	God can hear the Israelites and can save them. However, their continual evil deeds separate them from God. God was appalled that nobody represented His righteousness, so He worked Salvation Himself, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, the helmet of Salvation, the clothes of vengeance, and the cloak of zeal. God will apply His wrath to all of mankind which deserve it. Then men will fear and respect God. God will come to those that repent their sins. God promises that then God's words will be forever with them and their descendants.
Isa.60	God tells the Israelites to be happy, because God's light and glory is with them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be restored and their exiled people will return. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be financially blessed and kings and other nations will seek out guidance from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Foreigners and their kings will help rebuild <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and will serve them. God afflicted the Israelites in His anger, but now He shows them compassion. Any other nation which does not serve <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be destroyed. The Israelites former oppressors will bow down before them in Zion (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>). God will make the restored <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> everlasting, served by all the other nations. Then the Israelites will know that God is God, their Savior and Redeemer. There will never again be violence in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God will provide His light to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> in place of the sun and moon forever. They will have no more sorrow, will possess <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> forever, and will be blessed with many offspring. This will happen quickly.
Isa.61	The spirit of God is on <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who has been anointed to proclaim the good news about God's upcoming day of wrath and God's favor on the Israelites. God will restore <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to glory and its ruins will be rebuilt. Foreigners will provide labor for the Israelites. The Israelites will be called God's priests and ministers. They will become wealthy from other nations and will have everlasting joy for all generations to come such that Gentiles will know that the Israelites are blessed by God.
Isa.62	For <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sake, God will turn the nation of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> into a prosperous and righteous nation. God tells the Israelites to keep soliciting God until He has carried out this promise. God swears by His right hand that never again will enemies oppress them. God, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s savior is coming. The Israelites will be called Holy People, the Redeemed of God.
Isa.63	God's garment will be stained with blood on the day of His wrath. God will destroy nations by Himself in the day of His vengeance, and then will bring about Salvation. God has been kind to the Israelites. God redeemed the Israelites from their Egyptian slavery, but then they rebelled against Him and so God Himself fought against them. Then the Israelites remembered the God that led them out of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> and gave them <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. They asked where God was, why was His compassion withheld from them, and why did God make them wander from His ways and harden their hearts. They have been neglected by God.
Isa.64	The Israelites call for God to bring wrath to His enemies. Nobody has heard, perceived, or seen any other God. God helps those that do right, but the Israelites have sinned. Their acts of righteousness are like filthy rags. However, the Israelites are the clay, and God is the potter; they are the work of His hands. The Israelites plead for God to not remember their sins forever. The nation of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> has been destroyed, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> is desolate, and the Temple is in ruins.
Isa.65	God has shown Himself to the Israelites, but they have rebelled against Him. They mock God, offer sacrifices and incense outside of the Temple, commune with the dead, eat unclean meats such as pork, and act self-righteous. God has written that He will take vengeance for their sins and their fathers' sins, so He will destroy them. However, God will not destroy them all. God will bring forth some God-seeking Israelites to inherit <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> again, but God will punish those which forsake Him and choose to do evil. People will swear and take oaths by the God of truth because God has forgotten the sins of the past. God will make new heavens and a new earth. Then God will delight in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and there will be no more sorrow there. There will never again be people that die early; someone that dies before reaching 100 years old will be thought to have been cursed. Everyone there will enjoy the fruits of their labor because God will bless them and their descendants. God will help them before they even ask for help. Predatory animals will no longer eat prey, and snakes will eat dust and never harm anyone in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Isa.66	God has made the earth and the heavens. God esteems a humble, God-fearing man. Those that sacrifice animals, give grain offerings, and burn incense are like the pagans, and so God will punish them for not listening to Him. The enemies of the Israelites will be destroyed by God. God will re-establish <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> in one day. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be richly blessed by God. When the Israelites see this, they will know God. God will punish His enemies with fire and His sword, and will kill many people; pagans and those that eat unclean meats alike. All the nations will come to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and see God's glory. God will send the survivors of His wrath to distant nations to proclaim God's glory. Then the distant nations will bring back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> the exiled Israelites in their countries. The new heavens and earth will last forever, and their descendants will forever possess <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The Israelites will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those which have rebelled against God.

He was a prophet for God from the thirteenth year of King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler>Josiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the fifth month of the eleventh year of King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler>Zedekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> that He chose him to be a prophet from before he was conceived. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> complained that he can't speak well. God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to do whatever He commands and that he should not be afraid because God will protect him. God touched <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s mouth with His hand and told him that He put words into his mouth. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> that he will be over nations, destroying them and building them. God asks <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> what he sees. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> says that he sees an almond branch and a boiling pot tipping from the north. God says that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> sees correctly, because God is watching (which sounds like almond branch in Hebrew) to see that His word is fulfilled and the northern kingdoms will attack <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> as part of God's judgement on them for their pagan worship. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> not to be terrified by people, or else God will terrify him. Instead, he is to be brave because God is with him.
Jer.2	God remembers how the Israelites were devoted to God after they were brought out of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and how He protected them. God asks why the Israelites have now turned to idols, neglected what God has done for them, and defiled His land. Because the people now worship idols, God will punish them for generations, including their children's children. No other nation changes gods like the Israelites, who traded God for worthless idols. Not only have the Israelites forsaken God, but they have also turned to man made idols. The Egyptians have laid waste to Judah and humiliated its people. The Israelites brought this on themselves. Why do they seek protection through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> now? God will punish them for not respecting His power. A long time ago the Israelites stopped serving God and instead turned to idols. God started them out as a choice vine, but they have been corrupted into a wild vine. They cannot wash away their sins. God likens the Israelites relationships with pagan gods to that of a donkey in heat that is willing to take all mates. They worship idols, but then cry to God when they are in trouble. God says to let their idols save them. God has punished the Israelites in vain because they don't learn from correction and still kill the prophets. Why do the Israelites think they can neglect God? The Israelites claim to be innocent and do not think God should be angry with them. Therefore, God will make their alliance with the Egyptians fail.
Jer.3	The Israelites prostitute themselves to any idols there are, and they do all the evil they can, and yet they wonder why God's wrath continues. During <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler>Josiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s reign, God said that the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> turned to idols, so God divorced them. The people of Judah were influenced by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and also turned to idols. When the people of Judah did return to God, it was only a superficial pretense. Jeremiah is to tell the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to return to God, acknowledge their guilt, and then God will be merciful to them. God will bring back a sparse remnant of them to Zion (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>). God will guide them with shepherds after His own heart and they will be blessed with many offspring. The Ark of the Covenant will be forgotten because <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be God's Throne. All nations will come to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> to honor God and the Israelites will no longer be stubbornly evil. Judah and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be reunited, coming back to the land from the north. God wanted to bless the Israelites, but they have been like an unfaithful wife to Him, and so they are lamented. Come back to God. Confess that they are guilty in worshiping idols and have rebelled against God.
Jer.4	The Israelites should return to God and dispose of their idols. If they righteously swear to follow God, God will bless the nations. Come back to God whole heartedly or face God's wrath. God says to tell the people of Judah to flee to the fortified city of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> because an army from the north is on its way and will lay waste to the rest of the land of Judah. In that day, the king, officials, priests, and prophets will be afraid. Jeremiah marveled at how God deceived the people of Judah by telling them they will have peace. God says that Judah will be destroyed and the people should repent to be saved. They have deserved this bitter punishment from God. They will lament its severity. The people of Judah were like foolish children which did not understand God and knew only how to do evil. In Jeremiah's vision, Judah had become a desert wasteland where even the animals had fled. God says that He will destroy Judah, but not completely. Why do the people of Judah seek protection from sources other than God? The people of Judah will be distressed like a mother birthing her first child.
Jer.5	God says that if there are any honest people in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, He will forgive the city. They only superficially seek God's help. Jeremiah spoke to the people of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and found that everybody, including the leadership, had turned from God and stubbornly refused to repent. Therefore, God will send wild animals to tear them to pieces if they leave <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Why should God forgive them when they continually commit adultery with other gods and idols? God must punish them for this. God will destroy almost all of them for not listening and obeying Him. God will send an army from the north to destroy them, but not completely. Because they have served foreign gods, they will serve foreign men in a foreign land. The people of Judah have eyes but do not see, and have ears but do not hear. Should people not fear God, the maker of the sand which forever keeps the see from crossing it? These people turn away from God and do not respect His omnipotent power. They do limitless evil and wicked things, and will not honestly defend the fatherless or the poor, and so God will punish them. They love the way that their prophets lie to them.
Jer.6	The people of Judah should flee to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> because God is sending and army to destroy Judah. The city of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be sieged to punish them because they have been wicked, and the people of Judah will be reduced to a remnant. They will not listen to God's warning. God will not have mercy on anyone because of their age. Their houses, fields, and wives will be pillaged in God's wrath. They are all greedy, deceitful, and have no shame, so God will bring them down. They do not listen to God or follow His Law. Their incense, burnt offerings, and sacrifices are not the right kind and do not please God. God will give them obstacles to make them perish, and He is sending a mighty army to destroy them. Jeremiah says that they are anguished like a woman in labor because they have heard the army is coming, and that they should repent in sackcloth and ashes. God has made Jeremiah a tester of the people, and like poor metal which cannot be refined, the people continue in their wickedness despite punishment, and so God rejects them.
Jer.7	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to give this message at the entrance to the Temple. God tells the people that if they repent, act with justice, do not oppress foreigners, widows, or orphans, do not shed innocent blood, and do not worship other gods, then He will let them live safely in Judah. However, if they do not do these things, then God will not save them. See how God has destroyed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler>Shiloh</jLink></jLink></jLink> because the wicked people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> would not listen to God. God will do the same thing to Judah and the Temple. God will reject them just like he did <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0669G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0669G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0669G' clickHandler>Ephraim</jLink></jLink></jLink> (the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>). God will not listen to their prayers because they make offerings to the “Queen of Heaven” and other gods. God will pour out His wrath on man, beast, trees, and gardens. God told the Israelites to obey Him from when He took them out of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but they have not listened and they have done more evil than their forefathers. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> that the people will not listen to him. Therefore, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> should tell them that God has rejected this generation. The people worship idols and sacrifice their sons and daughters in fire, something that never entered God's mind. Therefore God will make the Valley of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1122' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1122' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1122' clickHandler>Ben</jLink></jLink></jLink> Hinnom known as the Valley of Slaughter, and it will be filled with the dead bodies of Israelites.
Jer.8	At that time, the bones of kings, officials, priests, and prophets of Judah will be taken out of their graves and left on the ground. The exiled surviving Israelites will prefer death to life. The people of Judah will not repent. They claim that they are wise because of God's Law, but their scribes interpret it falsely. Their wise will be shamed, and their wives and fields will be given to other men. They are all greedy and deceitful, so God will bring them down. Flee to the fortified cities, because the army is coming to destroy Judah. God has sent poisonous snakes to bite them. The people have angered God with their idol worship. The harvest has passed, and they have not been saved. Jeremiah laments that his people are crushed.
Jer.9	Jeremiah laments his slain, exiled, and sinful people. God says that they speak lies like a bow shoots arrows. They are all deceitful. God will refine them, and punish them for their deceit. Jeremiah weeps about the destruction. God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah because they have forsaken God's Law and they worship idols. God says that they should wail for their losses in repentance. Dead bodies will be all over the place. Boast only in God, who delights in kindness, justice, and righteousness. The days are coming when God will punish the exiled Israelites because they only superficially honor God.
Jer.10	God tells the Israelites that they should not learn about astrology or make wooden idols adorned with metal which cannot do anything. Jeremiah says that everyone should revere God because of His wisdom and power. Unlike man-made idols, God is the true God and is omnipotent. God says that the idols did not create the earth, but God did. God controls the oceans, clouds (rising from the ends of the earth), rains, and winds. Idols cannot control anything. God is the maker of all things. God tells the people that they should be ready to go into exile. God must endure this sickness. Nobody righteously follows God. The army from the north is on its way to destroy Judah. Jeremiah says that he knows that a man's life does not belong to himself, but to God. Jeremiah prays that God deal justly, not angrily, with the Israelites, because otherwise there would be none of them left. Jeremiah suggests that instead God should pour out His wrath against the Gentile nations for destroying Judah.
Jer.11	Since the time when God brought the Israelites out of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, His covenant with them was for them to obey Him so that they could have a land flowing with milk and honey. Despite multiple warnings, the people do not obey God. God brought on all of the curses that He promised them if they did not obey, but still they did not obey. The people of Judah have conspired against God and turned to idols, so God will destroy them. They have as many gods as they do towns. God will not listen to their prayers. God once thought they were beautiful, but will now destroy them for worshiping Baal. God showed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> that he was being led to the slaughter like a gentle lamb, as the men of his hometown of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6068G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6068G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6068G' clickHandler>Anathoth</jLink></jLink></jLink> were plotting to “cut him off from the land of the living”. Because of this, God plans to utterly destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6068G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6068G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6068G' clickHandler>Anathoth</jLink></jLink></jLink>, leaving no remnant in the “year of their punishment”.
Jer.12	Jeremiah says that God is always righteous, yet he asks God why He is allowing the wicked to prosper. Jeremiah prays that God will slaughter them, because it has been a long time waiting for justice. God tells Jeremiah that he will not be better off after God's judgement. Jeremiah should not trust his deceitful family. God will forsake the Israelites because they are like a lion that growls at Him, so He hates them. God will turn His <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> into a wasteland because nobody cares about Him. The army God sends will destroy the people of Judah. They people of Judah will sow wheat but will reap thorns and gain nothing, harvesting only God's anger. Sometime after the nations drag away the remnant people of Judah into exile, God will remove the nations from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and will bring the exiled Israelites back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. If the nations learn to obey God from the Israelites, then they will be welcome in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. However, if they will not listen to God, God will completely destroy them.
Jer.13	God has Jeremiah buy a linen belt and stuffs it in a rock crevice. Days later, God has Jeremiah get the belt, which he finds ruined and useless. God says that He will ruin the people of Judah like this belt because they worship idols and do not listen to Him. God tells Jeremiah to tell them that wineskins should be filled with wine. Then Jeremiah is to tell them that God will make everybody in Judah drunk and will have them fight one another. God will have no mercy when He destroys them. Jeremiah pleads for the people of Judah to repent, because they will be taken captive otherwise. God will shame and destroy the people of Judah because of their many sins.
Jer.14	God says that there is a severe drought in the land of Judah. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prays to God, wondering why He is not saving them from this drought despite their great sins. God says that he will not save them because of their wickedness, and He tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> not to pray for them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> asks why the prophets say that peace will be with them. God says that they are false prophets, and God will kill so many people of Judah that there will be nobody left to bury the dead. God will weep for His “virgin daughter”, the Israelites, during their destruction. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prays that God will come back to them and he repents for their sins. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> says that for the sake of God's name, He should save them because He is the only one who can save them.
Jer.15	Even if <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8050G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8050G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8050G' clickHandler>Samuel</jLink></jLink></jLink> pleaded for the people of Judah, God would show them no mercy. They will be killed, stuck in battle, starve, or become captives. God will send them four destroyers: the sword, dogs, birds, and beasts. The people of Judah will become despised by everyone because of what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler>Hezekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the former king of Judah, did in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God can no longer show compassion to the people of Judah, so He will destroy them and make them have numerous widows. God will deliver Jeremiah for a good purpose. God will have Judah plundered and its people enslaved because of their sins. Jeremiah pleads with God to save him because he has faithfully and joyfully worked for God. Jeremiah asks why God is letting him suffer, and he is wondering if God will truly deliver him. God tells Jeremiah that if he repents, then God will let him be His prophet and will protect him.
Jer.16	Then God tells Jeremiah not to marry and have children in Judah, because the people of Judah will die by disease, sword, and famine, and their bodies will be eaten by wild animals. God tells Jeremiah not to mourn for them, because God has withdrawn His blessing, love, and pity from them. God will stop the sounds of joy in Judah because the fathers of the people of Judah forsook God, worshiped other gods, and disobeyed His Law, and the present generation is even more wicked. God will remove them from Judah to a land unknown to them where they will worship other gods. However, the time will come when God will bring back the exiled Israelites to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God will send people to hunt down the people of Judah. The Israelites will be punished them double for their sin because they have defiled <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, God's land. God will teach all the nations that He is God.
Jer.17	The people of Judah's sin comes from deep within them and their sinful practices get passed down to their children. God will let the nation of Judah be destroyed and its people will be enslaved, because made God angry and His anger will last forever. Cursed is the man who trusts man, but blessed is the man who trusts God. God studies the heart and mind of a man and rewards him according to what he deserves. Those which forsake God will be shamed and destroyed. Jeremiah prays that God will shame and destroy his enemies and shelter him from the upcoming destruction. God tells Jeremiah to stand at the gates of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and proclaim that if the people of Judah keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it, then <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be inhabited forever. Otherwise, God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Jer.18	God is like a potter and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> is like the clay. If God says that He will destroy a nation but they then repent of their sins, then God will not destroy them. If God says that He will bless a nation but they then do evil, then He will reconsider the blessing He had intended for them. God says that He is planning to destroy Judah, so the people should repent of their sins, but they will choose to continue being evil. Because Virgin <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> has turned to idol worship, God will turn <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> into a wasteland. The people plotted to kill <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> because they thought he was worthless. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prays that God will punish his enemies.
Jer.19	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to take a clay jar near the Potsherd Gate and tell the people that God will bring such destruction on <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> that the ears of the people which hear about its destruction will tingle. This is because they worship other gods, killed the innocent, and even went so far as to sacrifice their sons in the fire to Baal, something which God never commanded or thought of requiring. Therefore, the Valley of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1122' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1122' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1122' clickHandler>Ben</jLink></jLink></jLink> Hinnom will become known as the Valley of Slaughter. Judah and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be ruined and their people will be killed and left for wild animals to eat. During the siege of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, they will resort to cannibalism. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> is to smash the jar and say that God will smash the city and the nation like the jar. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8612' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8612' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8612' clickHandler>Topheth</jLink></jLink></jLink> will become so full of the dead that they will not be able to bury anyone else there. This is because they worshiped other gods. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> then went to the Temple and said that God said He would destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and its surrounding villages because they would not listen to Him.
Jer.20	After the chief Temple officer, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6583I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6583I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6583I' clickHandler>Pashhur</jLink></jLink></jLink>, heard <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prophesying the destruction, he had <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> beaten and put in stocks.

Judah will be completely captured by the Babylonians, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6583I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6583I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6583I' clickHandler>Pashhur</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be taken to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> in exile where he and his friends will die and be buried. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> laments that God controls him and forces him to speak God's word, which only makes him become scorned and mocked. Even his friends wait to take revenge on him. However, God protects <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> from being completely prevailed against. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prays to see God's vengeance on those which would harm him. God rescues the needy from the wicked. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> curses the day that he was born and curses the man who told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s father that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was born, asking God to show that man no pity because he did not instead kill <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the womb. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> laments ever being born.

God will give the people of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> a terrible plague to kill many animals and people. Those which do not die by plague, sword, or famine will be captured by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who will kill them and show no mercy. God says that He is giving the people the choice; the way of life or the way of death. If they surrender, they will live. If they instead fight, they will die because God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God tells the royal house of Judah to provide proper justice or else God will destroy them. God is against <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> because of their self-reliant pride, so He will destroy them.
Jer.22	God tells Jeremiah to go to the palace in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and say: Do what is right and just. Rescue the oppressed. Do not treat aliens, orphans, or widows wrongly. Do not shed innocent blood. If they do this, they will keep the city of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Otherwise, God will ruin it. Although God once prized the land of Judah, He will turn it into a desolate desert because they have forsaken Him. Do not weep for the king, but instead weep for the exiled people who will never see the land of Judah again. Shallum, the King of Judah, will never return to Judah. Shallum built himself a big palace with slave labor and sought dishonest gain, unlike his righteous father <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler>Josiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler>Josiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s son <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3079' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3079' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3079' clickHandler>Jehoiakim</jLink></jLink></jLink> will have his dead body dragged out of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> because he disobeyed God from the beginning. He will be shamed with a painful end. God will send <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler>Jehoiachin</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his mother into Babylonian exile, never to return. God says that none of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler>Jehoiachin</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s offspring will prosper or ever rule in Judah.
Jer.23	God will punish the shepherds of the people of Judah for leading them astray. God will gather the exiled remnant of the Israelites back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and He will provide shepherds for them and they will no longer be afraid. The days are coming when God will raise a king of the Davidic lineage who will rule Judah and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> with justice. The king will be called “The LORD is Our Righteousness”. People will then swear by the God that brought the exiled Israelites back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Jeremiah laments the wicked prophets that Judah has. God says that their prophets and priests are godless and wicked, so He will punish them for leading the people astray and being wicked. The prophets are lying and have not been given messages from God because they did not seek God's guidance. God sees and knows everything. The deluded prophets speak about dreams to guide the people away from God. The prophet with God's word will speak it faithfully with power. God is angry with the false prophets. The people of Judah are asking what God has spoken. God will punish false prophets with everlasting disgrace and shame.
Jer.24	After king <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler>Jehoiachin</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the officials, craftsmen, and artists of Judah were exiled to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, God showed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> a basket of tasty figs and a basket of spoiled figs in front of the Temple. God says that the exiled people of Judah are like the good figs; they will be given a heart to know God and will be brought back to Judah, and they will be God's people. God says that king <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler>Zedekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, his officials, and the survivors of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be like the bad figs; wherever they are God will curse them to a life of reproach and ridicule, and any which stay in the land of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be completely destroyed.

Judah will be desolate, and all of these nations will serve <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> for 70 years. Then, God will punish the land of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> by making it desolate forever. At that time God will bring about all that He spoke against all nations; what is written in this book and spoken by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The Babylonians will be enslaved by many nations for what they have done. (Cross-reference 2 Chronicles 36) God gave <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> a cup of the wine of God's wrath and instructed him to give to the nations where God sent him, which included “all the kingdoms on the face of the earth”. The king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> is to drink it after everyone else.

God will bring judgement on all of mankind and will kill the wicked by the sword. Those killed by God will be littering the ground all over the earth. Now is the time when the leaders should weep, because God is going to destroy them in His fierce anger.

The prophesy is that if the people do not listen to God and obey His Law, then God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> like <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7886' clickHandler>Shiloh</jLink></jLink></jLink> was destroyed. The priests and prophets seized <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and threatened to kill him after he gave the prophesy. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that God gave him the prophesy and if they do not listen to God then God will destroy them, and they can do whatever they think is right to him. The officials said that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> should not be killed because he gave a prophesy from God. The elders said that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318K' clickHandler>Micah</jLink></jLink></jLink> of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4182' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4182' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4182' clickHandler>Moresheth</jLink></jLink></jLink> prophesied when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler>Hezekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was king that Zion (Judah) would be destroyed. The elders pointed out that because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler>Hezekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> then repented, God did not bring that disaster on them.

Jer.28	That same year, the fourth year in the reign of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler>Zedekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler>Hananiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prophesied that God would free <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink>, bring the exiled Israelites back, and the Temple furnishings back within two years. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that he hopes <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler>Hananiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> is correct, but that a prophet who prophesies peace is only from God if his predictions come true. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608A' clickHandler>Hananiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> took the yoke off of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, broke it, and proclaimed again that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s reign would end within two years. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> then got a prophesy from God, which he relayed to the people. He said an iron yoke will be put on all nations from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and even the wild animals will be controlled by him.

Jer.29	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> wrote a letter to the Israelites who were first put into Babylonian exile while under king <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler>Jehoiachin</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The letter stated: Build a life in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> and have lots of children. Do not listen to prophets who tell you anything different. After 70 years, God will come back for them and keep His promise. When they seek God with all their heart, they will find Him. God will bring all of the exiled Israelites back to their homeland. God will punish and destroy those now in the kingdom of Judah, and make any who are exiled from there objects of scorn because they have not listened to God. The exiled Israelites in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> have not listened either.

Jer.30	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to write God's message in a book because the days are coming when He will bring back the exiled Israelites. In an awful day everybody will be afraid, but God will free the Israelites from bondage to foreigners. They will serve God and king <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink> whom God will raise. God will completely destroy the nations to which they have been scattered. The Israelites will be punished too, but with justice. God has punished them cruelly like an enemy because of their great and many sins. However, God will heal their wounds and take revenge on their enemies. God will restore the Promised Land and give the Israelites numbers of offspring which will never be decreased and honor which will not be taken away. God will punish their oppressors. It will be like the old times when God was in the Temple. Their leader will rise from among them and be close to God. God's wrath will not be turned back until He accomplishes His plan.
Jer.31	Then God will be over all of the clans of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God will give aid to those who were not previously killed. God has loved the Israelites with an everlasting love and kindness. God will restore <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to being a joyful state. God will return the exiled Israelites, including the blind, the lame, and the pregnant. God will protect the Israelites. They will be prosperous and have no more sorrow. In Ramah, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7354' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7354' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H7354' clickHandler>Rachel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will cry because her children were killed, but God says to refrain from weeping because their work will be rewarded. They will return from their exile. The Israelites recognize that the punishment is for their sins, and they repent. Therefore God has compassion on them and calls them back from exile. God will create a new thing: a woman will surround a man. God will restore the land of Judah. Just like God oversaw their destruction, God will oversee their restoration. No longer will people say children are punished for their father's sins. Instead, everyone will die or be punished for his own sin. God will make a new covenant with the Israelites, putting His law in their mind and hearts. Then they will all know God, and He will forgive their wickedness and no longer remember their sins. Only if the sun, moon and stars stop shining and the ocean becomes still will the nation of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> cease to exist. Only if the heavens are measured and the foundation of earth is found will God reject all of the Israelites. The days are coming when <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be rebuilt for God and will never again be uprooted or demolished.

Just like God said would happen, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> is being destroyed by sword, famine, and plague. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> has bought the field per God's instructions. God then told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>: Nothing is too hard for God. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be taken and destroyed where they worshiped other gods by the Babylonians. The people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah have done nothing but evil since their youth. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> transgressed God since it was built and so God will destroy it. The people of Judah have worshiped idols and other gods, and sacrificed their sons and daughters to Molech. God is destroying <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but in the future He will gather them back from the lands where He had banished them and let them live in safety. He will be their God, and will give them a focus on God so that they will always fear Him for their own good and for their children after them. This will be an everlasting covenant, and God will always do good for them and inspire fear in them so that they will not turn away from Him. God will plant them in the land with all of His heart and soul. Just as God has brought destruction, God will bring them back as promised. Once again land will be bought with silver. God will make them prosperous again.
Jer.33	While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was still in the courtyard, God said to him: God, who made everything, says that call to Him, and He will answer and tell you unknown things. The houses of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be filled with the dead bodies of those slain in His wrath. However, God will heal <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and bring back the exiled Israelites from captivity. God will forgive all of their sins. All of the other nations will be in awe and fear of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> because of the renown, joy, praise, honor, prosperity, and peace it experiences due to God. Although Judah will become desolate, God will restore it to its former glory and people will make thank offerings to God there. The days are coming when God will keep His promise to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah and will make a righteous branch of the Davidic lineage rule in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. In those days Judah will be saved and will be safe. It/He will be called “the LORD Our Righteousness”. From then on, there will forever be a king of Davidic lineage ruling and the Levites will forever offer burnt offerings, burnt grain offerings, and sacrifices. Only if the day and the night stop coming will this covenant be broken. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s descendants and the Levites will become innumerable. As surely as the day and the night, God will restore the Israelites.

King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler>Zedekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> made a covenant with the people in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> to free their Hebrew slaves, which they did, but then changed their minds and enslaved them again. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3414L' clickHandler>Jeremiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell the people that in His covenant with the Israelites, they were to free their Hebrew slaves after six years of service, but their fathers ignored this commandment. Recently they repented and freed the Hebrew slaves, but then changed their minds. Because they have done this sin, God will “free” them to be killed by sword, plague, and famine. God will bring back the Babylonian army to destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6667H' clickHandler>Zedekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be given to the Babylonian army.
Jer.35	When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3079' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3079' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3079' clickHandler>Jehoiakim</jLink></jLink></jLink> was ruling Judah, God told Jeremiah to invite the Recabite family over for some wine. Jeremiah invites <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2970G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2970G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2970G' clickHandler>Jaazaniah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the rest of the Recabites over and offers them wine. They refuse, saying that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler>Jonadab</jLink></jLink></jLink> commanded them to never drink wine, build houses, sow seeds, or plant vineyards in order to live long. God tells Jeremiah to tell the people of Judah that the Recabites have obeyed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler>Jonadab</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s since it was given, but the people of Judah have not obeyed God. Therefore, God will bring on the destruction of Judah, but there will never fail to be a man of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3082G' clickHandler>Jonadab</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s lineage to serve God.

In the fifth year on the ninth month, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1263J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1263J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1263J' clickHandler>Baruch</jLink></jLink></jLink> read the scroll to everybody in the Temple.

The Babylonians will attack the Egyptian army and lay them to waste.

God will punish them but will not completely destroy them so that they will again return to their homeland and in peace and safety.

Jer.48	God, the King, reveals that the Moabites will be completely destroyed and laid to waste. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler>Moab</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be drunk and wallow in its vomit.

Afterwards God will restore the Ammonites. God will completely destroy the Edomites except for their orphans and widows.

Lam.1	<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> is deserted, the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> are in exile, and their allies are now enemies. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s splendor is gone, and the enemies of the Israelites laughed at its destruction. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> sinned, and so now it has been defiled by its enemies under God's orchestration. Let the day come when the Israelite's enemies will be treated like <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> has been treated for its sins, as God has said would happen.
Lam.2	God, like an enemy, has destroyed <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah. The royalty is exiled, the Law is no more, and prophets no longer hear from God. The remnant survivors are lamenting in destitution. False prophets led to this destruction, and now enemies scorn <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God fulfilled His decreed destruction of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The remnant grieve and repent to God. Who else has God ever decimated like <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> has been decimated?
Lam.3	God has made my life horrible, making me dwell in darkness like those long dead. God ignores my prayers. My life is bitter, and I have been mocked by my own people. Yet I have hope in God's unfailing compassion. God is good to those who hope in Him and seek Him patiently. Let a man strike you in the cheek. God does not shun men forever. Although God brings grief, He will show mercy. God does not willingly bring grief. Both good and bad things come from God. Let us realize that this grief and death comes from our sins, and we must repent to God. I have been hunted down by my enemies, but God hear my cries saved me when I had almost died in a pit. God, you know the wrongdoing of my enemies, so repay them with your wrath.
Lam.4	<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and its people have become worthless. Its parents are cruel to their young like ostriches. Its noble men are brought low. Poverty, drought, and famine waste it away. God has done all of this because of the sin of its prophets and priests. God has scattered the remnant in exile without favor or honor shown to priests and elders. The enemies of the Israelites should rejoice now, because in the future God's wrath will be upon them and the punishment of the Israelites will end.
Lam.5	God, look at how You have disgraced the Israelites. We have lost our land and many men. We are punished for the sins of our fathers. We are in famine and drought, and are subjects to slaves. Enemies all around try to kill us. Our women have been raped. We are forced into heavy labor and are without respect. We have no more joy. Woe, we have sinned. God, why do You forget and forsake us for so long? Or have You utterly rejected us?
Ezk.1	When the priest <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, son of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0941' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0941' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0941' clickHandler>Buzi</jLink></jLink></jLink>, was 30 years old and near the Kebar River, corresponding with fifth year of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3078' clickHandler>Jehoiachin</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s exile, he saw the heavens opened and saw visions of God. He saw a burning windstorm from the north, with glowing metal in the center of the fire which was surrounded by four humanoid creatures. Each creature had four faces and four wings. They had four hands like men but had feet like bronze cows. Each had the face of a man, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle. Each had two wings spread upward, touching each adjacent creature, and two wings covering their bodies. They followed the spirit without turning as they went. They were illuminated as if on fire and moved quickly like lightening. Beside each creature was a sparkling crystal wheel on the ground. Each of the four wheels had a wheel intersecting them so that they could go in any direction without turning. The wheels were large with rims full of eyes. The wheels moved any way that the creatures did because the creatures spirits were in the wheels. Above the creatures was a ceiling like sparking ice. When the creatures moved, their wings were very loud. A voice came from a Man seated on a sapphire throne above the ceiling. The Man looked like He was on fire from the waste down, and was radiating rainbow light all around Him. This was the likeness of God, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> fell facedown and listened.

God tells “son of man” to not rebel like the Israelites, and to eat what God gives him. God then gave <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> a scroll with words of lament, mourning, and woe on both sides.

Next he is to lie on his right side for 40 days, bearing the sin of the house of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> one day for each year they have sinned. God will prevent him from turning until the time is up. While laying on his side for the 390 days, God says <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> should drink water at certain times and eat bread at certain times made of wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, which is to be baked over burning human feces to symbolize how the Israelites will eat defiled food in their exile. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> protests, saying that he has never defiled himself with unclean food.

Then when his symbolic siege is over, he is to burn a third of the hair plus a few strands in the symbolic city, strike a third of the hair around the city with his sword, scatter a third to the wind (because God will pursue them with a sword), and save just a few hairs in the folds of his garment. God says that <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> is more wicked than the nations around it because they have rebelled against God's laws. Because of this God will punish them, doing what He has never done and will never do again. God will make fathers eat their children and will scatter the survivors because they have defiled the sanctuary with pagan idols and practices. A third will die by plague or famine, a third will die by the sword, and a third will be scattered. Then God will be avenged and His wrath will subside. Then they will know God has spoken. God will make them subject to reproach and will decimate them with famine, plague, beasts, and bloodshed.

God will soon repay the Israelites for their sins, punishing them without pity or mercy, and then they will know that God is God. Not one of them will preserve their lives because of their sins. They will die by sword, plague, and famine. Those who survive will be shamed and scattered. Foreigners will pillage <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the Temple.

Because of this and the violence in the land, God will punish them in anger and without pity or mercy, and will not listen to their cries.
Ezk.9	God moves from above the cherubim to the Temple threshold and calls in 6 armed guards, and they came with a man dressed in linen with a writing kit. God tells the man in linen to put a mark on the forehead of anyone who laments the sins of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and then tells the guards to kill, without pity or mercy, anyone without the marks on their foreheads. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> asks God if He will kill all of the Israelites in His wrath. God answers that He will give them what they deserve. The man in linen returns saying that he is finished his task.

God went to threshold of the Temple. The man went into the Temple and got coals from one of the cherubim. God then goes above the cherubim, and God and the cherubim left the Temple and went to the east outer gate of the Temple.

God will give them a pure heart and a new spirit so that they will obey His laws. They will be God's people, and He will be their God.

Therefore, God has <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> act out the coming exile.

The prince and a remnant of Israelites who are not killed by sword, plague, or famine will be scattered among the nations where they will learn that God is God. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tremble and shudder while eating and drinking to symbolize the despair the Israelites will have as the land is laid to waste.

Therefore, God will unleash his wrath on them, kill them all, and expose their lies. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to prophesy against the female mystics who prophesy lies to the Israelites to make a living. They have killed those who should not have died by discouraging the righteous while encouraging people to continue in their sins. They will know that God is God when He frees the Israelites from their deceptions.

If the prophet speaks a prophesy which God entices him to do, then God will kill that prophet too. Then the Israelites will no longer stray from God, and He will be their God.

God will unleash his wrath on them. Even though they have come out of the fire, fire will still consume them.

She (meaning <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s ancestors) was abandoned, but God watched over her. When mature, God took her into covenant with Him, and she became His wife in marriage. God bathed, cleaned and adorned her so that her beauty was the envy of other nations. However, she trusted in her beauty and fame, prostituting herself to idols, and even using gifts, which God had provided to her, in her idol worship. She went on to sacrifice children to idols, without respect for what God had done for her. She prostituted herself to Egyptians, Philistines, Assyrians, and Babylonians. Actually, she was worse than a prostitute, because she offered her affections for free, and actively pursued illicit lovers by giving them gifts. Because of all this, God will sentence her to the fate of adulterers and murderers. He will gather all of her ex-lovers to strip her down and destroy her, thereby stopping her prostitution. Then God's jealousy and wrath will turn aside. She is like her mother the Hittite in that she despised her husband and children. Her older sister was <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and her younger sister was <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but her sins surpassed her sisters' sins. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> was haughty, “arrogant, overfed and unconcerned” and did detestable things, and had no pity to the poor and needy, so God destroyed them. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> did not do half of the sins she did.

God will deal with her as she deserves for breaking the covenant, but He will still remember the covenant and will establish an everlasting covenant with her. When she is ashamed and remembers her ways, and then receives her sisters <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink>, then He will give them to her as daughters.

The eagle also took seed and planted it by water, where it grew into a leafy vine. There was another powerful eagle, and the vine grew its roots and stretched its branches towards that eagle. This vine will not survive. This parable means that <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> carried off <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s king, nobles, and leaders to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, where they made an oath of treaty with the Babylonians.

Ezk.18	No longer will the Israelites say that a child is punished for his father's sins. A righteous man who keeps God's laws and decrees will live. A wicked man who does not will die. If the son of a wicked man instead acts righteously, that son will live. Each person is only responsible for their own actions. If a wicked man repents and acts just and right, he will then live and none of his sins will be remembered, and God is pleased if this happens. If a righteous man changes and acts wickedly, he will die and none of his righteousness will be remembered.

Ezk.20	On the tenth day of the fifth month of the seventh year of Zedekiah's reign, some elders asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to get instructions from God. God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell them that God will offer no guidance to them because of the sins their fathers committed. God had made a covenant with the Israelites to bring them from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the Promised Land, but they rebelled and continued worshiping Egyptian idols. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God punished them in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but then delivered them from their suffering for the sake of God's name. God gave them rules to live by in the desert, but they rebelled. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God punished them in the desert, but appealed to their children for the sake of God's name. Their children then rebelled. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God punished them in the desert, but not severely for the sake of God's name. God swore to them in the desert that they would be scattered throughout nations. God then let them do evil so that He could punish them to the point of horror. When God brought them into the Promised Land, they worshiped idols and committed pagan offerings, so God will not give them guidance. God will not let them worship idols, but will gather them together from the scattered nations in wrath into the desert, where face to face, God will judge them. Just like their forefathers coming out of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the unworthy will not enter <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> go ahead and worship idols, but God will force obedience. All of the Israelites will serve God and give Him offerings and sacrifices after He brings them from the scattered nations back into <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Then the Israelites will be shamed by their former actions, when God brings them back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> in His mercy for His name's sake. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to prophesy against the southern forest (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>) that God is about ready to set an all-consuming fire in the forest which everyone will know that God has set. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells God that people say that he is just speaking parables.
Ezk.21	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to prophesy against the sanctuary of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, saying that God will draw His sword and cut off the righteous and the wicked, and God will not return His sword to its scabbard. God's sword is sharpened and polished, ready to slay. The slaughter will come on every side, even to the royal lineage. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to set up a signpost where the road forks to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and to Rabbah. The king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> will reach this fork and seek a sign of divination, and God will make the divination choose <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> for attacking. The Israelites will be captured for their guilt. The time has come for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s punishment. God will exalt the low and bring the exalted down. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be ruined and not restored until God gives it to its rightful owner. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell the Ammonites that God's sword is drawn against them. God will judge them, and they will be remembered no more.
Ezk.22	God asks <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to judge <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and tells him to prophesy against them. Their days of sinfulness are at an end, and they will become an object of scorn. They commit all manners of sins and have forgotten God. God will defile them and scatter them among the nations to prove that God is God. They have all become the dross of metals, so God will gather them into <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and melt them inside the city. The leaders, priests, and people of the city do not obey God's laws, and the prophets lie by giving false visions. God looked for a man to help restore <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but found none. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God will consume them in His wrath.
Ezk.23	God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that two sisters of the same mother became prostitutes. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0170' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0170' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0170' clickHandler>Oholah</jLink></jLink></jLink> (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>) and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler>Oholibah</jLink></jLink></jLink> (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>) became prostitutes in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> while they belonged to God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0170' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0170' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0170' clickHandler>Oholah</jLink></jLink></jLink> gave herself to Egyptians as well as Assyrians, who were dressed in blue. Therefore, God gave her to the Assyrians, who killed her and took her children. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler>Oholibah</jLink></jLink></jLink> saw this, but continued her prostitution. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0172' clickHandler>Oholibah</jLink></jLink></jLink> went even further by servicing both the Assyrians and the red Babylonians. She then despised the Babylonians and sought after the Egyptians instead because they had big genitals and lots of semen. Therefore, God will bring His wrath in the form of her ex-lovers, the Assyrians and Babylonians. They will strip her wealth, take her children, cut off her nose and ears, and kill all the rest. She will drink the same cup of wrath as her sister, the consequence of her sins. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to judge these sisters for their idolatry, child sacrifice, and desecration. They chose to prostitute themselves out to foreign nations, so God let them. Righteous men will judge them. God will send the mob against them to pillage and kill, thereby God will put an end to their sins. This episode will serve as a warning to all nations. Then these sisters will know that God is God.
Ezk.24	On the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to record this date because the king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> sieged <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> on that day. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell the Israelites to make a stew of the finest meats. They have spilled blood on bare rock. Therefore, God will spill their blood on bare rock in wrath and revenge. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> cook the stew, eat it, and set the empty pot on the fire to burn its deposits away. But the deposits will not burn away, just like the sins of the Israelites. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God will cleanse them through His wrath.

God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that He will kill his wife, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> must not outwardly mourn her death. She dies. The Israelites inquire of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell them that He is about to desecrate the sanctuary, the object of their affection, and kill the children they left behind. They will not mourn for this loss, just like <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> did not mourn for his wife. Then they will know that God is God. God will make <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> speechless until the sanctuary is defiled and a fugitive tells him the news as another sign of God.
Ezk.25	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to prophesy against <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5983' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5983' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5983' clickHandler>Ammon</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Because the Ammonites celebrated the destruction of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah, God will give them over to the Babylonians and will exterminate them. Then they will know that God is God. For the same reasons, God will punish <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler>Moab</jLink></jLink></jLink> as well, and the Ammonites will not be remembered. The Moabites will then know that God is God. Because the Edomites took revenge on Judah, God will kill their men and animals through war. They will know God's vengeance. Because <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6429' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6429' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6429' clickHandler>Philistia</jLink></jLink></jLink> sought to destroy Judah, God will destroy them in His vengeance, and they will know God is God.
Ezk.26	On the first day of the month in the eleventh year, God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to prophesy against <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Because <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink> rejoiced at the destruction of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, God will send <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> to utterly destroy them. They will be plundered, killed, and reduced to a flat rock. They will never be rebuilt. People all along the sea will lament its destruction. God will take them to the grave, and they will not return to the land of the living. They will never be found again.
Ezk.27	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to recite a lament to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink> was perfect in beauty, made and ornamented with all of the best materials.

Many nations traded their various goods with you. You set out to sea full of cargo, but an east wind will break you to pieces. Everything and everyone will sink into the sea the day of the shipwreck. Everyone else around will mourn your loss and shudder in the horror of your destruction.

The king thinks that he is as wise as a god, but he is a man. Through his wisdom and skill he has amassed great wealth. Because he thinks that he is as wise as a god, God will have ruthless foreigners attack him and his city. They will end his arrogance, killing him in a violent death, and will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

He was perfect. He dwelt in Eden, on the Holy Mount, and among fiery stones. He was wise, beautiful, and adorned with the finest materials. God had made him become so exalted because of his blameless ways, until evil was found in him. He became dishonest in trading, so God punished him. He became proud of his beauty, which corrupted his wisdom, so God has made an example of him for all nations, reducing him to ashes in a horrible end.

Ezk.33	God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that if a watchman warns his people of an invasion which God initiates, but they do nothing to protect themselves, then their blood is on their own heads. However, if the watchman provides no warning, his people will die because of their own sins, but their blood will be on the watchman's head. God has made <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> watchman for the house of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, so he must warn them or be held accountable. God takes no pleasure in killing the wicked, but would rather them repent and live. A man's previous righteousness will not save him if he turns to sin. A man's previous wickedness will not kill him if he repents of it. This is God's justice, despite what man thinks of it. On the fifth day of the tenth month in the twelfth year of exile, a fugitive from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that the city was captured.

The leaders have profited from the sheep (people), but have not taken care of them in return. It is their fault that the people are scattered in exile. Therefore, God will remove these leaders from their power over the people.

God will be their God. God will give them peace; safety from beasts, drought, famine, plundering, and invasion. They will know that God is God when He rescues them from their oppressors. They will be free from scorn and will be known for their crops. Then they will know that God is God.

Towns and ruins will be rebuilt. Men and animals will be fruitful. The nation will be more prosperous than before. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will know that God is God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will never again be conquered, suffering life losses of its citizens from wars. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will not be the subject of scorn. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> a prophesy for the Israelites. Before exile, the sins of the Israelites had been unclean to God, like a woman's period. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God punished them and scattered them throughout other nations. The other nations scorned God's name because of the exile. Therefore, not for the sake of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but for the sake of God's name, He will do the following things to prove that He is holy so that the nations will know that God is God. God will bring the Israelites back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and will clean their sins with water. God will give them a new heart and His spirit so that they will obey God's decrees and laws. God will prevent them from becoming unclean. They will have abundant crops and no famines, and this will remind them of their former sins and be ashamed. When their sins are cleansed, they will rebuild towns and ruins. The land will be farmed, becoming like the garden of Eden. The rebuilding and replanting will prove to other nations that God has done this. God will multiply the Israelites like sheep for offerings.

After 7 months, the Israelites will bury the remains of the army in a valley east of the Dead Sea, blocking the way for travelers, over the course of 7 months. The Israelites will remember that day.

Ezk.40	On the twenty-fifth year of exile, the tenth month of the fourteenth year after <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s fall, God gives <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> a vision of a new Temple in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. A man who looked like bronze tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell the Israelites everything that he sees. What follows are several dimensions for the layout of the Temple and its grounds. The east gate, outer court, north gate, south gate, and gates to the inner court are described, including their palm tree decorations. There was a room for washing burnt offerings, and were tables for killing the burnt, sin, and guilt offerings. There are rooms for the “sons of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler>Zadok</jLink></jLink></jLink>,” the only Levites who can approach God.
Ezk.41	This chapter continues with the dimensions and layout of the Temple. The outer sanctuary, inner sanctuary, Most Holy Place, the Temple itself, side rooms on three levels, priests' rooms, west building, and table altar inside the inner sanctuary. The sanctuary was decorated with palm trees and two-headed cherubim. One head was a lion. The other head was a man.
Ezk.42	This chapter continues with the dimensions and layout of other structures. The north and south priest chambers as well as the outermost Temple wall. The priests make the holy offerings, and must change out or their holy clothes before going into the outer courtyard. The Temple wall separated the holy from the common.
Ezk.43	The bronze man takes <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the each gate, where he sees God's glory, like he had seen it before, coming from the east. God's glory filled the Temple. At the inner court, God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that this Temple is where God will live forever. The Israelites and their kings will never again defile God's name. They had done so before, which is why God had punished them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> should tell the Israelites God's master plan, and go on tell them the details of the plan if they are ashamed of their sins. The whole mountain top where the Temple is will be holy. The design of the altar is described. The priests, from the <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler>Zadok</jLink></jLink></jLink> branch of Levites, will sacrifice a bull for a sin offering on the altar and then burn it outside the sanctuary. On the second day the priests will sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, and then sacrifice a bull and a ram burnt offering with salt. For 7 days the same goat, bull, and ram offerings will be done to atone for the altar. From the eighth day on, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings will be done on the altar. God will then accept them.
Ezk.44	The gate to the inner sanctuary is to remain shut because God is in the sanctuary. Only the prince (ruler or king) can eat in the gateway in God's presence. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to tell the Israelites that they had broken God's covenant by letting foreigners work in the sanctuary. However, not even the foreigners living among them will be allowed into this sanctuary. Only the <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6659G' clickHandler>Zadok</jLink></jLink></jLink> branch of Levites will serve God in the holy areas of the sanctuary because only they remained faithful to God when the Israelites strayed. The other Levites will perform other, less holy duties outside the sanctuary. The Zadokites must wear linen clothes and turbans when in the inner court and change out of the linens before leaving the inner court. They must keep their hair trimmed, not shaved or grown long. They cannot drink wine in the inner court. They can only marry Israelite virgins or widows of priests, not other widows or divorced women. They will teach about the holy and the common, and the clean and unclean. The priests are to act as judges. They will keep God's laws and feasts. They will keep Sabbaths holy. Priests must not defile themselves by going near dead people, except for their parents, children, brother, or unmarried sister. If a priest is so defiled, he can cleanse himself after 7 days. The priests will eat the offerings, and only possess what is given to God, including the best of the firstfruits. Priests cannot eat anything killed by wild animals.

The prince will own the land to the east and west of the holy portion. God's princes will never again oppress the Israelites. The Israelites will live in lands according to their tribes. Accurate weights and measurements will be used. The Israelites will give the prince grain, oil, and one out of every 200 sheep as a special gift. The prince will provide these as offerings to make atonement for the people. The prince will provide sin, grain, burnt, and fellowship offerings at the appointed feasts. On the first day and seventh day of the first month a young bull is to be sacrificed to atone for unintentional sins for the Temple. On the fourteenth day of the first month, the Israelites are to observe Passover. The prince will sacrifice a bull to atone for his sins and those of the Israelites. Then 7 bulls, 7 rams, and a male goat sin offering must be made for each of 7 days, along with grain and oil offerings, all of which are provided by the prince.
Ezk.46	The east gate to the inner court will be open only on Sabbaths and days of New Moons. The prince will go up to the gateway on those days to worship while the priests perform his sacrifices. Then the prince will leave. But the gate will remain open until night. The prince's Sabbath sacrifices will be 6 male lambs, a ram, grain, and oil. The prince's New Moon sacrifices will be a bull, 6 male lambs, a ram, grain, and oil. When the people come into the outer courtyard during appointed feasts, they are to leave at the gate opposite the one where they came in at. The prince's offerings at appointed festivals will be a bull, a ram, any amount of lambs, grain, and oil. For a prince's freewill offerings, the inner court gate will be opened like on Sabbaths, but will be closed after the offering is made. Every morning there will be a burnt offering of a year-old lamb, along with a grain and oil offering as a lasting ordinance. When a prince passes down inheritance, only passing down to a son will be permanent. If the prince gives to a servant, that inheritance reverts back to the prince on the Jubilee year. A prince cannot take land from other Israelites. The priests will have a bakery in the inner court for holy sacrifices. The outer court also had many kitchens for cooking sacrifices.
Ezk.47	The bronze man took <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to see a stream of water flowing eastward, which originated from under the Temple just south of its east entrance. It continued to flow eastward outside the outer court, progressively getting deeper, eventually becoming a river which was too deep for anyone to cross. Many big fruit trees grew on its river banks. The bronze man told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3168H' clickHandler>Ezekiel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that the river flows into the Dead Sea, changing its salt water to fresh water. Lots of different kinds of fish will live in its waters, so fishermen will fish there. However, the swamps and marshes around the Dead Sea will remain salty to provide salt. The fruit trees on the banks will produce fruit every month, and their leaves will be used for healing. God provides the boundaries for the land of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The land is to be divided up among the tribes of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The land will be an inheritance for the tribes as well as for aliens who immigrate to that land. Tribes must give immigrants some land.
Ezk.48	God describes the division of the land by tribe, as well as the holy portions for the Zadokites and the other Levites in the holy city, and the land for the prince. The Zadokites and other Levites cannot sell or give their land to anyone outside of their tribe. Workers from all of the tribes will tend pastures and farms to supply food for the workers of the holy city. There will be twelve gates to the holy city, each one named for a tribe of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The holy city will be called “the Lord is there.”

Among those men selected were <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608T' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608T' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2608T' clickHandler>Hananiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4332I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4332I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4332I' clickHandler>Mishael</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5838Z' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5838Z' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5838Z' clickHandler>Azariah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who were then renamed with the Babylonian names of Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego respectively. The king had allotted royal food and wine for these men, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> protested because eating it would break God's dietary laws. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0828' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0828' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0828' clickHandler>Ashpenaz</jLink></jLink></jLink> pushed them to eat the royal food because he would be held responsible for their malnourishment, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> suggested a ten day trial of these four men eating only vegetables. After the ten days, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0828' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0828' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0828' clickHandler>Ashpenaz</jLink></jLink></jLink> found these four men in better shape than those on the royal diet, so he let them continue to be vegetarians. God gave the four men knowledge and understanding in all that they learned, and granted <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> the ability to understand dreams and visions. After the three years of training, they entered into the king's service. The king found these four men much more wise than any of the magicians or enchanters in his entire kingdom. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> was there until the first year that King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink> ruled.
Dan.2	King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> had a troubling dream in the second year of his reign. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> the king summoned all of the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and he demanded that they tell him both what was his dream and what its meaning is. These wise men said that nobody could do such a thing except for the gods themselves. The king became furious, and told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0746B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0746B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0746B' clickHandler>Arioch</jLink></jLink></jLink>, his chief guard, to round up all of the wise men for execution. Upon hearing about this, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to the king and asked for more time to interpret the dream. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> told Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to plead with God for mercy. That night, God revealed the dream to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> in a vision. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> praised God for giving him this knowledge, saying among other things that God establishes and deposes kings, and knows hidden things. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0746B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0746B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0746B' clickHandler>Arioch</jLink></jLink></jLink> to take him to the king so that he could interpret the dream. The king asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> if he could recount the dream and interpret it. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that only God can reveal such hidden things, that God gave the king a prophetic dream, and that God revealed the dream to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to give the king understanding of it. The dream was about a statue of a man with a gold head, silver chest and arms, bronze belly and thighs, iron legs, and iron and clay feet. A rock was cut out without human hands, and the rock smashed the feet of the statue. At that time, the statue disintegrated without a trace, but the rock became so big that it filled the entire earth. The gold head represents the king's present empire, which God has given him. The silver represents an inferior kingdom after his. The bronze is another kingdom after the silver one which will rule the entire world. The next kingdom will be strong like iron and break all other kingdoms, but will be divided and brittle like the statue's feet. In the time of those kings, God will set up an everlasting kingdom which will end all of those kingdoms. King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> was so impressed that he claimed that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s God was the God of gods, and he rewarded and promoted <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to rule over <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> used his influence to get Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego appointed as administrators in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Dan.3	King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> made a huge golden idol, and made a decree that everyone must worship the idol when music was played, and that anyone who did not worship was to be thrown into the furnace. Astrologers pointed out to the king that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to obey this new decree. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> the king threatened to kill these three men in the furnace, but they continued to refuse to worship the idol. They claimed that God could save them from the furnace, and said they would still refuse even if God would not save them. The king was so angry that he ordered that the furnace be made seven times hotter than normal. He ordered that the strongest guards should throw the three tied-up men into the furnace. In the process of throwing the three men into the furnace, the guards died due to the heat. The king looked into the furnace in amazement to find the three men still alive and untied, and that a fourth man was with them who looked like a “son of the gods.” The king called to the three men to come out of the furnace. When Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out, they did not show any signs at all of the fiery heat, even on their clothes. The king made a new decree that anyone who spoke ill of God would be cut to pieces and have their houses destroyed. The king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

The king had a disturbing dream, so he summoned all of the wise men in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> to interpret the dream, but they could not. Finally, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> came to the king, so the king told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> the dream, which went like this: There was a tree which grew tall enough so that it touched the sky and could be seen throughout the world. All sorts of animals sought shelter under the tree. An Angel of God appeared and said to trim the tree down to the stump, but leave the stump to be in the wild for seven years, with the mind of and living like an animal. The Angel said that this was to show mankind that God was in complete control of men and kingdoms. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> interpreted that the tree represented the king, and God was going to strip the king from the reign of his kingdom, and that the king would live like an animal in the wild eating grass like cattle until the king finally admitted that God was in control, which would take seven years. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> then begged him to repent. One year later, while the king was bragging about how he had built <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> up from his own work, God spoke from Heaven saying that the king was to be cursed to the fate revealed by the dream. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> went crazy and lived in the wild for seven years until he acknowledged that God was in control. He praised God, saying that His kingdom and His dominion were eternal. With <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sanity was restored, and he again became the king of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The king praised God because God does what is right and will humble those who are prideful.
Dan.5	King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler>Belshazzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> hosted a large banquet, during which he called for the gold goblets from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s Temple to be brought forth. The king and his guests drank wine from these goblets while praising various idols. Then the king watched in utter horror as he saw disembodied fingers of a human hand writing a message on a plaster wall.

None of these wise men could interpret the writing, which frightened the king even more. The queen told the king about how his father, King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink>, had relied upon a blessed man named <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> (also known as Belteshazzar) to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> the king summoned <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and offered him the same reward if he could interpret the writing on the wall. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells the king that he does not want the king's gifts and rewards, but will provide an interpretation of the writing. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler>Belshazzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> that God had made <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> the king over all nations and languages, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> became arrogant. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God stripped <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5019' clickHandler>Nebuchadnezzar</jLink></jLink></jLink> from power and made him live like an animal until he humbled himself and acknowledged that God is sovereign over all kingdoms, appointing whoever He wants to rule them.

The first beast was a lion with the wings of an eagle. Its wings were torn off, it stood like a man, and was given the heart of a man. The second beast was like a bear, which had three ribs in its mouth and was told to eat its fill of flesh. The third beast was like a leopard with four heads, four bird wings, and was given the authority to rule. The fourth beast was frightening and powerful, with large iron teeth, it completely crushed and destroyed its victims. It had ten horns, but then a new small horn came up and pulled out the first three horns. The new horn had the eyes and mouth of a man and it spoke arrogantly. Then, the “Ancient of Days,” who had white clothing and hair, was enthroned. His throne and its wheels were flaming, and a river of fire flowed out from Him. Many thousands attended Him, and one hundred million stood in front of Him. His court was there and the books were opened. The small horn continued to boast, but was then slain and destroyed in fire. The other beasts were stripped of power, but allowed to live for a while. Someone like a “son of man” came with the clouds. He went to the Ancient of Days, and was given everlasting sovereignty over all people and nations with an everlasting kingdom. Troubled, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked one of the men standing around in the vision to interpret the true meaning of the vision. The man said that the four beasts are four kingdoms, but God's saints will takeover the kingdom forever. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked the man further about the terrible fourth beast with its ten horns, after observing how the new small horn had warred with and defeated the saints until God judged to give the kingdom to the saints. The man explained that the fourth kingdom will conquer the entire earth. There will be ten kings of that kingdom, and then another king will rise up to subdue three of the kings, will speak against God and oppress His saints, and change the set times and laws. God will let the saints be oppressed for “a time, times and half a time.” Then the court will condemn this king, and all of the kingdoms “under heaven” will be given to the saints, God's people. God's kingdom will be everlasting, and all rulers will worship obey Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> was frightened by this vision, and so he kept it a secret.
Dan.8	In the third year of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1112' clickHandler>Belshazzar</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s reign of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> had a vision like so: <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> was standing by a canal in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5867A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5867A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5867A' clickHandler>Elam</jLink></jLink></jLink> (southwest Iran). He saw a ram with two long horns; the longest horn had grown later. No animal could stand against the ram as it charged north, south, and west. Then, a goat, with a horn between its eyes, charged from the west, covering the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat charged the ram, breaking the ram's horns and trampling on the ram. At the height of its power, the goat's horn broke, and four new horns grew towards the four winds. Another horn grew from one of the horns, and grew powerful, capturing the south, east, and the “Beautiful Land.” The horn grew until it reached the heavens and then it trampled on some of the stars. It stopped the daily sacrifices and it was allowed to defile the sanctuary because of the saints' rebellion. Truth was thrown to the ground. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> heard a “holy one” ask another holy one how long it would take for this to all be fulfilled, the “rebellion that causes desolation” and the defiled Temple. The holy one told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that the sanctuary would be reconsecrated in 2300 days. Gabriel, “one who looked like a man,” called <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> “son of man” and told him that this vision regards the “time of the end.” Gabriel told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that the two-horned ram represented kings of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4074H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4074H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4074H' clickHandler>Media</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler>Persia</jLink></jLink></jLink>, while the goat was <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler>Greece</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the large horn represented its first king. Four weaker kingdoms will then arise from the Grecian empire. Near the end of these kingdoms as they turn rebellious, a stern, intriguing king will arise. This king will be mighty and arrogant, and will cause great devastation which will extend even to the Israelites, thereby taking his stand against the “Prince of princes.” This king will be destroyed, but not by human power. The number of days that the Temple will be defiled is true (2300). Then Gabriel said that this concerns the distant future, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> should keep it a secret. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> was deeply disturbed by this vision, and he could not understand it.

Gabriel then told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> the prayer's answer: There will be seventy “sevens” (literally weeks, but also interpreted as sets of seven years) to stop sinning, atone for their sins, establish everlasting righteousness, and anoint the most Holy. From the time when the order is given to rebuild <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, in seven sevens there will be an anointed ruler, and in sixty-two more sevens the restoration of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be complete, despite there being trouble in those times. Then the anointed ruler will be no more, and a subsequent ruler's people will destroy the city and the sanctuary, and war and desolation will continue until the end. The new ruler will make a covenant with many for one seven, and will stop sacrifices in the middle of that seven. The new ruler will establish abominations that cause desolation until the decreed end is applied to him.
Dan.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month in the third year of the reign of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink> by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> had a vision. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> had mourned, ate no meat, drank no wine, and used no lotions for three weeks prior. Then, by the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2313' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2313' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2313' clickHandler>Tigris</jLink></jLink></jLink> river <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> saw a man of fire dressed in linen and gold with a booming voice who only <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> could see, but those around <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> were still frightened away. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> fainted, but the fiery man touched <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, waking him up. The fiery man told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> was highly esteemed because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> had humbled himself and looked for understanding. Therefore, God sent the fiery man to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3566' clickHandler>Cyrus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had resisted the fiery man for twenty-one days, until the chief prince, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler>Michael</jLink></jLink></jLink>, helped the fiery man. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> complains of being weak. The fiery man encouraged <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to be strong, and told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> that soon the fiery man would fight against the prince of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler>Persia</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and then the prince of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler>Greece</jLink></jLink></jLink> will come. The fiery man said that he would tell <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> what was in the “Book of Truth,” and that nobody supported the fiery man except for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s prince, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler>Michael</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Dan.11	The fiery man continues, telling Daniel that the fiery man himself had been helping <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867I' clickHandler>Darius</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The fiery man then gives Daniel this prophesy: There will be four more kings of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6539' clickHandler>Persia</jLink></jLink></jLink>, with the fourth being the richest and inciting the enmity of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3120H' clickHandler>Greece</jLink></jLink></jLink>. A mighty king will rule, but his empire will end and it will be divided into four pieces in cardinal directions. The king of the South will be powerful. His daughter will make an alliance with the king of the North, but she will be killed. A new king of the South (of royal lineage) will then conquer and plunder the king of the North, taking the spoils back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Later, the king of the North will unsuccessfully attack the South. The North will later attack again, making it to the South's fortress, and then be defeated. Again the North will invade the South with a better army. Israelites will rebel against the South at that time unsuccessfully. The North's king will capture and control <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Then the king of the North make an alliance with the king of the South through marriage of the North's royal daughter. The king of the North will unsuccessfully attack the coastlands, and then retreat to his own country, only to be destroyed in a few years. The North's successor will come non-violently. The successor will have a large military victory and will kill a “prince of the Covenant.” During a time of peace, this successor king of the North will invade and plunder provinces unprovoked. Then the king of the North will wage war against the South, and the South will lose because of plots against the South's king. The end will come at the appointed time. The king of the North will return with great wealth after taking action against the “holy covenant.” Later, the king of the North will again invade the South, but this time ships on the western coastline will thwart his advance. The king of the North will then vent his frustration on <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, desecrating the Temple, stopping daily sacrifices, and establishing an “abomination that causes desolation.” The king of the North will corrupt many, but others who know God will resist. The people who resist will struggle so that they will be purified for the “time of the end.” This king of the North will blaspheme God, and say that he is better than everyone else and God. The king will be successful until the appointed time. He will not desire women. He will worship a god of fortresses. With the help of a foreign god, the king will conquer fortresses, and will honor and enrich those who honor him. At the “time of the end,” the king of the South will attack the North. The king of the North will counterattack, capturing <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3864' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3864' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3864' clickHandler>Libya</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and Nubia. Then, the king of the North will hear of troubles in the east and north, and so he will return to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Yet his end will be there, with no one to help him.
Dan.12	The fiery man continues to give <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> a prophesy: At that time, there will be distress like never before. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4317Q' clickHandler>Michael</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the great prince and protector of the Israelites, will arise, and will save those Israelites whose names are in the Book. The dead will awaken, and be granted either everlasting life or everlasting contempt. The righteous will shine like stars forever. Then the fiery man tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> to seal up the scroll of this prophesy until the “time of the end,” and that many will read the scroll to be wise. There were two “others” there, and one asked the fiery man how long it would take to fulfill this prophesy. The fiery man replied that it will take “a time, times and half a time” to complete, and the Israelites' power will be broken. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> inquired of the outcome, and the fiery man replied that many will be purified, that the wicked will not understand but the wise will understand, that from the time when the sacrifices are stopped and the abomination is set up will be 1290 days, that those who last until “the end” at 1335 days will be blessed, and that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be rewarded.

When they had their first son, God said to name him “<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3157K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3157K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3157K' clickHandler>Jezreel</jLink></jLink></jLink>,” because God will end the kingdom of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the Valley of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3157K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3157K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3157K' clickHandler>Jezreel</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

The people should change from their spiritually adulterous ways. Otherwise, God will strip their kingdom, send a drought to the land, and stop their celebrations; punishing them for worshiping Baals and seeking protection by allying with other nations instead of seeking God. Later, God will lure the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> back to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and again become their God. They will no longer worship idols. God will make the people safe from animals and weapons. The land will again be productive.

The House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will live a while without kings or sacrifices. Then they will humbly return to their land and to God and their king <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the “last days.”
Hos.4	God said that the House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> has abandoned God. They instead turn to idol worship. They have become lawless. Their sins kill the land, the beasts, the birds, and the fish. The people are as despicable as those who accuse priests. Their prophets are blind. God will destroy their land because of their sins. Even the priests are wicked, and encourage wickedness in the people. God will restrict their food supply and limit their numbers. The people prostitute themselves and drink old and new wine, which ruins their understanding. God will not punish their prostitutes or adulteress women, because the men seek them out due to their lack of understanding. The House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> should stay away from Judah and not swear by God. The House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> is stubborn, persisting in their sins.
Hos.5	God knows of the House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s corruption, sins, and rejection of God. The House of Judah is stumbling with them. God has removed His blessing from the House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. They have children out of wedlock. God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah like a lion, and take the surviving remnant from their land.

Hos.6	Return to God and He will heal us. God will revive us in two days, and will restore us in three days so that we can live with God. If we acknowledge God, He will come surely back to us.

God will make them miscarry, give them dry breasts, and will slay their children. Because of their wickedness in Gilgal, like in the days of Gibeah, God rejects them. They will be scattered among other nations.
Hos.10	God will destroy the means of idolatry in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Therefore they will be destroyed. They shall acknowledge no god or savior but God Himself. God had taken care of them, but in their prosperity they rejected Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God will attack them like a sly and ferocious animal. God angrily gave them a king per their request, and will now take their king away in His wrath. Their sins are on record. They do not learn from their pain, so God will kill them without compassion. They will have a drought. God is stirring up an invading and plundering army from the east. The Samaritans will bear their guilt through war. Their children and pregnant women will be killed.
Hos.14	<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sins have caused their ruin.

Then God will heal them, love them, and bless them. They will become firmly rooted in the land, and will be attractive and famous for their prosperity. The wise will righteously walk in God's ways, but the rebellious will stumble.
Jol.1	Judah has experienced destruction not seen before, and should be told about to all later generations. Locusts (likely a metaphor for an army) have devoured everything. A powerful nation has invaded and stripped the land. The Day of the Lord is near. The Temple offerings have been withheld, and drought has ravished all food sources. The priests should mourn and the elders should fast and cry out to God.
Jol.2	The Day of the Lord is close; a day of gloom, clouds, and darkness. A powerful and large army, like never was before or ever will be, will completely consume everything in its path. Other nations will be afraid of this army. Nothing will be able to withstand this massive, mighty army which God will lead. Repent, because God may have pity. Let the Israelites mourn, fast, and cry out to God for mercy. Then God will take pity, give them abundant food, and will never make them subject to scorn again. God will drive away and destroy the northern army. God will restore the land's vegetation and provide abundant rainfall and harvests. God will repay the Israelites for the years that His locusts ate everything. Then they will know that God is their God. Afterward, God will send His spirit to all of the Israelites. The young and old, men and women, will have prophetic dreams and visions. God will show wonders in the sky and on earth; blood, fire, and smoke. The sun will darken and the moon will turn blood red before the Day of the Lord. Everyone who calls on God's name will be saved on Mount Zion and in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Let all of the nations prepare for war and gather in the Valley of Jehoshaphat to be judged by God. They are abundant in wickedness. The Day of God is near in the Valley of Decision. The sun, moon, and stars will no longer shine. God will rage from Zion, but will protect the Israelites. Then the Israelites will know that God dwells in Zion, God's holy hill. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be holy. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will never again be invaded by foreigners.

God will destroy the nation of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, because they sell the righteous and the poor as slaves, they deny justice to the oppressed, their fathers and sons have sex with the same woman, they worship idols and profane the Temple, they forget what God has done for them, they force the Nazirites to drink wine, and they silence the prophets. None of the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be able to save themselves from God's wrath.
Amo.3	God will punish the nation of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>) for its sins because of God's covenant. When God threatens, it will come to pass. When disaster comes to a city, God caused it. Let <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0795' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0795' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0795' clickHandler>Ashdod</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> witness <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s great sins. An enemy will conquer, destroy, and plunder <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and God will only save a remnant of its people. The altars of its false gods and its splendor will be destroyed.
Amo.4	The idolaters who corrupt <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be cast out. Let the Samaritans keep sinning and bragging about their offerings as they love to do. God tried to get them to return to Him by punishing them with famine, drought, blight, mildew, plagues, and even fires like those at <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6017' clickHandler>Gomorrah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Yet they have not returned to God. Therefore, they should prepare to meet God.
Amo.5	Amos laments: Virgin <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> is fallen and abandoned. God says that her people will be decimated, and only those who seek God will live. If they do not seek God, God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>. They promote injustice, cast out righteousness, hate the truth, and oppress the poor. Therefore, they will not reap the pleasing benefits of their labor. Prudent men keep quiet in these evil times. If they seek God, then they will live and He will really be with them. If they repent, God may have mercy on their remnant. The Day of God will mean darkness, not light. There will be no safe haven. God hates their sacrifices and religious rites. They should instead seek justice and righteousness. Yet because they worship kings and idols, God will send them into exile.
Amo.6	The comfortably wealthy of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah will be among the first to be exiled. God will make <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> be conquered and destroyed because of their great pride in themselves. God will bring a nation to oppress <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> from Lebo <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler>Hamath</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the Valley of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6160G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6160G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6160G' clickHandler>Arabah</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

God then showed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler>Amos</jLink></jLink></jLink> a third prophesy, where God stood by a true wall with a plumb line. God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler>Amos</jLink></jLink></jLink> that He will no longer spare the people of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Their holy places will be destroyed during a war God will bring to them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0558J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0558J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0558J' clickHandler>Amaziah</jLink></jLink></jLink> accused <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler>Amos</jLink></jLink></jLink> of conspiring for rebellion. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler>Amos</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that God made him become a prophet, that God says <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0558J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0558J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0558J' clickHandler>Amaziah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s family will be destroyed, and that God will make the people of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink> go into exile.
Amo.8	God showed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5986' clickHandler>Amos</jLink></jLink></jLink> a bowl of ripe fruit and said that the time is ripe to punish the House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> for its sins, such as its lack of compassion for and taking advantage of the poor, and being greedy to the point of irreverent and dishonest practices. God will not forget their sins. God will make the land shake, make the sun go down at noon, and turn their singing into mourning. God will prevent His words from being spoken there for some time. God will bring about the forever-lasting fall of idolaters.
Amo.9	No matter where the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> try to hide, God will kill them with the sword. They will be slain wherever they have run, even in exile. God looks on them for evil, not for good. God is omnipotent. God will scatter a remnant of the House of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> throughout all the nations, preserving the good ones, but all those who unrepentantly sin will be slain. Yet a day will come when God will restore the Israelites to the Promised Land as they used to be, when the city ruins will be rebuilt, and vineyards and gardens will be planted. They will never again be uprooted from the Promised Land.
Oba.1	God has summoned nations to humble <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler>Edom</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s pride. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler>Edom</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be pillaged, and their allies will turn on them. Because of their hostility towards the Israelites, they will be destroyed forever. They had better not take joy when God destroys <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, or add to the hardships of the Israelites. The Day of God is near for all nations. As they do, so it will be done to them. All nations will drink God's wrath of destruction, but the Israelites will again possess the land which God gave to them. The Israelites will utterly wipe out the Edomites. The land of the Israelites will expand to include the land of the Edomites, Philistines, and Samaritans, possessing from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6886' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6886' clickHandler>Zarephath</jLink></jLink></jLink> to Negev. This will be God's kingdom.
Jon.1	God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, son of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0573' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0573' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0573' clickHandler>Amittai</jLink></jLink></jLink>, to go preach against the city of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> tried to flee, and boarded a boat headed in the opposite direction. God sent a violent storm which threatened the security of the boat. The sailors panicked and called to their gods, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> went below deck and slept. The sailors woke up <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and begged him to pray to his god too. Through divination of lots, the sailors determined that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the reason for the storm, so they questioned <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s background. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that he was a Hebrew God-worshiper, and that he had already told them about his running away from God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the sailors to throw him overboard to calm the sea. Instead, the sailors tried to row back unsuccessfully as the storm got worse. Finally, they relented and threw <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> into the sea. The storm immediately calmed. The sailors then feared God; sacrificing and vowing to Him. God sent a big fish which swallowed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> for three days and three nights.
Jon.2	While in the fish, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prayed to God, saying: God rescued me when I called to Him. I was banished, but sought God's Temple again. While I was deeply sinking, I prayed to God. Idol worshipers miss out on God's grace, but I will sacrifice to God. God provides salvation. Then, God commanded the fish to spit out <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> on dry land.
Jon.3	God again told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to go to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink> was a big city. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> arrived and proclaimed God's judgement against the city; that it would be overturned in 40 days. The people believed God's message. Everyone in the city donned sack cloth. The king decreed for there to be a city-wide fasting for the people and the animals, and that everyone should repent of their evil and violence, in an attempt to gain God's mercy. Because of these actions, God decided not to destroy the city.
Jon.4	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was angry with God for showing mercy. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> had known that this would happen because God is gracious, compassionate, and slow to anger, and God relents causing calamities. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> asks God to kill him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> made a shack east of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink> from which to watch the city. God made a vine grow over the shack for extra shade, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was happy about that. The next day God made a worm kill the vine, sent a hot wind, and made the day sunny and hot so that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> grew faint. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> wished he was dead. God asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> if he has a right to be angry about the vine. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> told God that he does have that right, and he is very angry. God mocked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> for being concerned about the very temporary vine. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink> has over 120000 people who cannot tell right from wrong, and lots of cattle, so God is concerned about it.
Mic.1	God's word came to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4318K' clickHandler>Micah</jLink></jLink></jLink> of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4182' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4182' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H4182' clickHandler>Moresheth</jLink></jLink></jLink> while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3147H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3147H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3147H' clickHandler>Jotham</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0271G' clickHandler>Ahaz</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2396G' clickHandler>Hezekiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> were kings of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>: Everyone on earth, listen to God.

God will bring destruction to these two nations, bringing in a conqueror. The people will be exiled.
Mic.2	God will punish the Israelites for being wicked, plotting evil deeds, stealing, and telling prophets not to speak. They will go into exile. Lying prophets are what they want. God will gather back the remnant of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and there will be plenty of Israelites once more. Someone will break the way before them, and they will break through the gate to leave. Their king will go before them. God will be at their head.
Mic.3	God will turn His back on the leaders of the Israelites for their sins against God's people. God will stop talking to the corrupt seers, diviners, and prophets, unlike Micah. Because of the corrupt leaders and prophets, God will destroy Zion and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Mic.4	During the “last days,” God's Temple will be established in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and people many nations will come to it to learn God's Law and His ways. God will judge and settle disputes for big nations all over the world, so much so that they will no longer train for war and they will turn their swords into plowshares. The other nations can follow their gods, but the Israelites will forever follow God. At that time, God will bring back the scattered Israelite remnant and make a strong nation. God will rule them forever beginning from that day. The kingship of the former Israelite kingdom will return to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. It will be painful for the Israelites to go into exile to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but God will redeem them there. Now there are many nations gathered to fight the Israelites, but they do not know that God plans to destroy them. Zion will destroy many nations, and devote the war plunder to God.
Mic.5	Marshall the troops, because a siege is underway, and the aggressor will hit <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s ruler on the cheek. From the small clan of Judah of Bethlehem <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0672G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0672G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0672G' clickHandler>Ephrathah</jLink></jLink></jLink> will come a ruler with ancient origins for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The Israelites will suffer until the time has come for this ruler to lead the Israelites back to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. This ruler will lead and protect the Israelites like a shepherd, strengthened by God and ruling in God's name. His (God or this ruler?) greatness will be famous throughout the world. When the Assyrians invade <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, this ruler will organize several leaders in a counter-attack which will result in capturing the lands of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0894' clickHandler>Babylon</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The relatively small number of Israelites will tear through their enemies despite being vastly outnumbered. At that time, God will take vengeance on nations which have not obeyed Him; killing their horses, destroying their chariots, leveling their cities, stopping their witchcraft so that they cannot cast spells, and demolishing their idols.
Mic.6	God has a grievance with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God redeemed them from slavery in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink>, provided <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0175' clickHandler>Aaron</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4813G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4813G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4813G' clickHandler>Miriam</jLink></jLink></jLink> to lead them, and protected them on their journey through the wilderness. No amount or type of offerings, even an offering of your firstborn son, will please God if you are not obeying His Law of mercy and justice, and you are being humble. God knows that they have stolen treasures, used dishonest weights and measures, have violent rich men, have lying people, and have worshiped idols. Therefore, God will destroy them. They will be hungry, and be invaded with their possessions and produce taken from them before their possessions and produce can be enjoyed.
Mic.7	Micah is dismayed at the wickedness of his people. Corruption is rampant. Even the best ones are still bad. You cannot trust anyone, even your own family. Because of the Israelites' sins, God is punishing them. Yet the Israelites will survive to see their enemies destroyed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s cities will again be rebuilt, and the scattered Israelite remnant will return, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be desolate first because of the Israelites' sins. God will shepherd the Israelites back in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> like before. God will perform miracles like during the Exodus. Nations will be weaken and ashamed, and will fear God. Who is like God, who forgives the sins of the Israelite remnant? God will show mercy on the Israelites and will keep His covenant with His people.
Nam.1	The prophet announces the coming judgment on <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5151' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5151' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5151' clickHandler>Nahum</jLink></jLink></jLink> emphasizes that God is jealous and avenging. The chapter describes God as a powerful figure who is slow to anger but will not leave the guilty unpunished. Key themes include God’s power over nature and His ability to protect those who trust in Him. The chapter ends with a message of comfort for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, assuring them that their enemy will be destroyed.
Nam.2	Focuses on the destruction of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Nahum describes the invading forces that will come against the city. He portrays the Assyrians as fearful and in chaos, emphasizing the fall of their stronghold. Significant imagery is used to depict the chariots, soldiers, and the walls of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink> collapsing. The chapter serves as a warning to the Assyrians and a message of hope for the oppressed.
Nam.3	Nahum continues to elaborate on the destruction of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He highlights the reasons for this judgment, including the city's violence, idolatry, and deceit. Nahum uses vivid descriptions to portray the city’s downfall, including the imagery of bloodshed and devastation. The chapter concludes with a lament for <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink>, showing that its destruction is certain, and it will be left desolate. The key message is that no one can escape God’s judgment.
Hab.1	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler>Habakkuk</jLink></jLink></jLink> complains to God that there is rampant injustice, violence, and conflict, and that the wicked are prevailing. God answers that He is rousing the Babylonians to punish (inferred) the House of Judah. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler>Habakkuk</jLink></jLink></jLink> then asks God why He tolerates the wickedness of the Babylonians.
Hab.2	God tells <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler>Habakkuk</jLink></jLink></jLink> that at a certain time, God will save those who are faithful to Him and will punish the Babylonians, because they are arrogant, greedy, and murderous. All of their work will come to nothing when God acts and puts them to shame. They foolishly trust in idols, but God is reigning in His Temple, and will silence the earth.
Hab.3	God came from Mount <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6290G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6290G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6290G' clickHandler>Paran</jLink></jLink></jLink>, showing glory and power. He sent plague and pestilence, shook the mountains, enraged the seas, and sent river torrents. God threshed the nations in His wrath to save His chosen people. God killed the leader of the wicked nation with his own spear. Despite all of the frightening chaos and devastation around <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2265' clickHandler>Habakkuk</jLink></jLink></jLink>, he will still rejoice in God, who strengthens him.
Zep.1	During the reign of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2977G' clickHandler>Josiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> as King of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, God spoke to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6846H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6846H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6846H' clickHandler>Zephaniah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God will destroy men, animals, birds, and fish. God will punish the land of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> for its idolatry and rejection of God. The Day of God is near. God has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated His invited. On God's day of sacrifice, He will punish the princes, the king's sons, those in foreign clothes, idolaters, merchants, and those who are complacent. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be plundered and destroyed. God's day will be a day of gloomy wrath and death. God will quickly kill everybody on earth.
Zep.2	If the Israelites humble themselves, do what God commands, and seek righteousness, then maybe God will spare them on Judgement Day. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6429' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6429' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6429' clickHandler>Philistia</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be destroyed, including <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5804' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5804' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5804' clickHandler>Gaza</jLink></jLink></jLink>, Achod, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6138' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6138' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6138' clickHandler>Ekron</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3667G' clickHandler>Canaan</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and their lands will belong to the remnant of the Israelites. Because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4124H' clickHandler>Moab</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5983' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5983' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5983' clickHandler>Ammon</jLink></jLink></jLink> threatened and mocked the Israelites, God will destroy them and turn their land into salt pits and wastelands forever, which the remnant of the Israelites will own and plunder. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3568A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3568A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3568A' clickHandler>Cush</jLink></jLink></jLink> will also fall by the sword. God will destroy <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink>, turning <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink> into a desolate, desert home for wild animals. Everyone will scoff at their fall.
Zep.3	Woe to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> she ignores God's correction, her rulers are ravenous, her prophets are treacherous, her priests defile the Temple and twist the Law. God is in her (<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>) giving righteous justice everyday, but He is ignored. God though that she would see how He dealt with other evil nations and thus fear God, but they ignore God's correction. Therefore, God will pour out His wrath on all nations, consuming them all to purify them, and make them all yield into worshiping God together. Even from far away people will come to worship God. At that time, God will have purged the sinful people from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and so the punishment will end. The remnant left behind will do no wrong and will faithfully serve God as their king. God will take delight in the Israelites. He will remove their burdens, and give them praise and honor world-wide. Their fortunes will be restored.
Hag.1	God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler>Haggai</jLink></jLink></jLink> to give to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink> (the governor of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>) on the first day of the sixth month of the second year of King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler>Darius</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God marvels that the people have not understood why they are suffering; with insufficient harvests, poor clothing, lack of financial success, and drought. They have chosen to rebuild their own houses, meanwhile neglecting the rebuilding of the Temple, so God has been punishing them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and all of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> obeyed God's request, and began working on the Temple on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. God was with them, and stirred up their spirits.
Hag.2	God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler>Haggai</jLink></jLink></jLink> to give to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink> on the twenty-first day of the seventh month of the second year of King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler>Darius</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God encourages them to work hard on the Temple. God is with them, His Spirit is among them, and He is keeping the covenant given during the Exodus. Soon, God will “shake” all of the nations, and select people from all nations will give silver and gold to the Temple to bestow it with glory. This Temple will be even more spectacular than the one <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> had built. God will grant peace from the Temple. God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler>Haggai</jLink></jLink></jLink> to give to the priests on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Before the Temple reconstruction began, God afflicted them with blight, mildew, and hail because they ignored His Temple. However, now that they have started the reconstruction, God will bless them. God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2292A' clickHandler>Haggai</jLink></jLink></jLink> to give to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink> on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. God will cause great destruction to foreign kingdoms. At that time, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be God's chosen king.
Zec.1	God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> on the eighth month of the second year of King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler>Darius</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God was angry with the Israelites' forefathers. If the Israelites return to God, He will return to them. Their forefathers were destroyed for their evil deeds. The Israelites heard <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and repented. God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month of the second year of King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler>Darius</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> had a vision of a man riding a red horse, followed by red, brown, and white horses. They had ridden throughout the world and found it at peace. God had punished <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> for 70 years. God was jealous for <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Zion, and was angry to find the other nations feeling secure. God declared that He would return to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, rebuild the Temple, and grant the Israelites overflowing prosperity. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> saw the four horns (nations) which had scattered <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Next he saw four craftsmen overturn the four horns.
Zec.2	In his vision, Zechariah saw a man about to measure <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but God stopped the man because <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be so big, so full of men and livestock, that God will be a wall of fire around it, and its internal glory. God calls the diaspora of Israelites back home. He will send an angel to punish nations which have harmed the Israelites, and those nations will be pillaged. God will live among the Israelites. Many nations will worship God and become His people. God will inherit Judah and live in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Zec.3	In his vision, Zechariah saw the high priest <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> standing in front of God and Satan. God rebuked Satan, and called <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> a “burning stick snatched from the fire.” <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s clothes were filthy, so God had some angels give <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> clean cloths. God told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> that He had taken away <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sins, and clothed him richly. God then said if <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> obeys the Law, then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> will run the Temple and have access to God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his associates are a sign of the times, because God will soon bring the Branch, God's prophesied servant. God set a stone with 7 eyes in front of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and God will remove the sins of this land in one day. At that time, everyone will be friendly neighbors.
Zec.4	In his vision, Zechariah saw a gold lampstand with seven lights, and seven channels to the lights. There was an olive tree on both left and right sides of the lampstand. God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink>: what will happen will happen through God's Spirit. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2216' clickHandler>Zerubbabel</jLink></jLink></jLink> will build the Temple from start to finish. The seven eyes of God rejoice to see the Temple reconstruction. The two olive trees are the two people anointed to serve God.
Zec.5	In his vision, Zechariah saw a large flying scroll with curses banishing thieves and everyone who swears falsely, which will destroy thieves and those who swear falsely. In his vision, Zechariah saw a measuring basket full of sin and wickedness of all of the land in the form of a woman. Two flying, stork-winged women flew the basket between heaven and earth, to ultimately set the basket in Babylonia.
Zec.6	In his vision, Zechariah saw four chariots emerging from two mountains of bronze. God is sending these four chariots in four different directions. The chariot which had black horses went north, and there they gave God's Spirit rest. God told Zechariah to take gold given by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2469G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2469G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2469G' clickHandler>Heldai</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2900J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2900J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2900J' clickHandler>Tobijah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3048J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3048J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3048J' clickHandler>Jedaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and turn it into a crown to be set on <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s head. Then Zechariah is to tell <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> that he is the Branch, and he will build the Temple and be a priest on his throne in harmony. The crown will be a memorial in the Temple. People from far away will help build the Temple. This will come true if <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3091J' clickHandler>Joshua</jLink></jLink></jLink> obeys God.
Zec.7	God gave a message to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148v' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> on the fourth day of the ninth month of the fourth year of King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1867H' clickHandler>Darius</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The people inquired of God if they should continue to mourn for the Temple's destruction. God reminds them that He had asked their ancestors to provide justice by obeying the Law, mercy, and compassion, to not oppress widows, orphans, aliens, or the poor, and to not think evil of each other. However, their ancestors ignored God, so God ignored their cries, exiled them from the Promised Land, and scattered them in foreign nations.
Zec.8	God is jealous for Zion. God will live in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, which will then be called the City of Truth on the Holy Mountain. Old people and children will again be seen in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God will bring the remnant back to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He will be their God, and they will be His people. Be strong in rebuilding the Temple. God will stop punishing the Israelites, and will instead bless them with abundant harvests. They will be a blessing to other nations. They need to speak truth, give fair judgements, not plot evil, not swear falsely, and love truth and peace. People from many foreign nations will go to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> to inquire of God.
Zec.9	God will apply His wrath to the land of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2317' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2317' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2317' clickHandler>Hadrach</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1834' clickHandler>Damascus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H2574G' clickHandler>Hamath</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6721G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6721G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6721G' clickHandler>Sidon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0831' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0831' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0831' clickHandler>Ashkelon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5804' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5804' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5804' clickHandler>Gaza</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6138' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6138' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6138' clickHandler>Ekron</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and Ashnod. The only ones left will be those who worship God, and they will go to Judah. God will now defend Zion. Never again will the Israelites be oppressed. Zion's humble, righteous, saved king comes riding on a colt of a donkey. God will grant peace, and the king will proclaim peace to nations and rule from the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6578' clickHandler>Euphrates</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the western ends of the earth. God will free the Israelite prisoners and slaves, returning them home to restore and bless them. God will send the restored Israelite nation to attack the Greeks, and they will defeat the Greeks quickly and powerfully while being protected by God. The Israelites will be attractive to God.
Zec.10	Consult with God instead of deceitful idols and lying diviners. The people are like sheep without a shepherd. God is angry with the present shepherds, the leaders. God will care for His flock, the people of Judah. The foundation of everything will come from Judah, including all future rulers. Judah will have a mighty military because God is with them. God will restore Judah and Ephriam as though He had not rejected them. God will signal and redeem them, and gather them back. When they return, there will be so many there that there will not be room for them all. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4714H' clickHandler>Egypt</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0804G' clickHandler>Assyria</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be destroyed in the process of the Israelites returning.
Zec.11	<jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3844G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3844G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3844G' clickHandler>Lebanon</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be burned, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1316' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1316' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1316' clickHandler>Bashan</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be cut down, and the thicket of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler>Jordan</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be ruined. God had marked the Israelites as a flock for slaughter. Previously, God had pastured them with Favor and Union, but they had unsuitable shepherds and went astray, so God broke Favor with them. God left it up to them to decide if paying God respect was worth anything, and they, in turn, chose to pay only a minuscule amount. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God broke Union, and thus the people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> were separated from the people of Judah. Then God gave them a worthless shepherd to be their leader.
Zec.12	Judah and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be besieged by all the nations of earth. However, God will make them undefeatable. Those nations attacking the Israelites will hurt themselves, their horses will be blinded and panic, and their riders will go insane. Judah's leaders will realize that this is because of God, and will subsequently thrash all of their attackers. God will protect all the Israelites on that day, but He will destroy the attacking nations. Then God will give the Israelites a spirit of grace and supplication, and each of the Israelite clans will mourn for how they have mistreated God in the past.
Zec.13	At that time a fountain will be opened to cleanse the Israelites from sin and impurity. Also, God will remove all idols and prophets from the land. Anyone who prophesies will be killed by their own parents. Prophets will lie about having been prophets. God will strike down a shepherd close to Him and kill 2/3 of all the people in the world. The remaining 1/3 will worship Him, and He will be their God and they will be His people.
Zec.14	The Day of God is coming, when plunder will be divided up among the Israelites. God will gather every nation to fight against <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Half of the city will be ransacked; its people exiled and its women raped, but half of the people will remain. Then God will fight against all of those nations with an incredibly strong army. That day will be without light, cold, frost, daytime, or nighttime, with light in the evening. Then living water will flow from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and God will be king over the entire earth. The whole land will become like <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6160G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6160G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6160G' clickHandler>Arabah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be intact and raised up. It will never again be desolate or destroyed. God will send a plague of rotting flesh to all of the nations which attacked <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> which will affect men and animals, and they will all panic and attack each other. Judah will fight, and will pillage the wealth of all of the surrounding nations. The survivors will worship God as King on a yearly basis, celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles. If they do not, God will give them no rain. “Holy to the Lord” will be inscribed on every horse bell and cooking pot in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> and Judah. No Canaanite will be in God's house.
Mal.1	God spoke through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4401' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4401' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4401' clickHandler>Malachi</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God says that He has loved <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler>Jacob</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but hated <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6215G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6215G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6215G' clickHandler>Esau</jLink></jLink></jLink>, which is why the land of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler>Edom</jLink></jLink></jLink> is laid waste. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H0123G' clickHandler>Edom</jLink></jLink></jLink> may rebuild, but they will always be under God's wrath, proving God's great power to the Israelites. God says that the priests have shown contempt for God by offering diseased and crippled animals. God will not accept their offerings. God's name will be great among the nations, and every place will burn incense and sacrifice pure offerings in God's name. People who cheat on offerings are cursed. God is a great king, to be feared by the nations.
Mal.2	Because the priests have not honored God, God will spread dung from their offerings on their faces. The priest will be despised and humiliated for breaking the covenant God had made with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3878' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3878' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3878' clickHandler>Levi</jLink></jLink></jLink> and for not perfectly obeying God's Law. This admonition will come so that the covenant God had made with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3878' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3878' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3878' clickHandler>Levi</jLink></jLink></jLink> can be preserved. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3063G' clickHandler>Judah</jLink></jLink></jLink> has broken faith by worshiping a foreign god. This is why God no longer listens to them or accepts their offerings. They have disturbed God by claiming that God is pleased with people who do evil, or by questioning where God's justice is.
Mal.3	A messenger will prepare the way for God. Then God will suddenly appear in the Temple. When the Day of God comes, He will purge out any Levites who sin. Then God will have men who bring acceptable offerings in righteousness just like in prior times. God will condemn sinners who do not fear Him. God does not change, so the Israelites will survive. If they return to Him by giving the whole tithe, then God will richly bless them, and all other nations will consider them blessed. God promises that they will again see the distinction between those who righteously serve God and those who do not.
Mal.4	God's Day is coming. God will burn all sinners. The righteous Israelites will trample the wicked people. Obey God's Law. Before God's dreadful Day, God will send <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> to turn peoples hearts to their families. If their hearts do not change, God will curse the land.

The moment <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> emerged from the water, the Holy Spirit descended on Him, and God spoke from Heaven, saying that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was His Son.
Mat.4	Then the Holy Spirit led <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to the desert, where He fasted for 40 days. At the end of the fasting, the Devil told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to turn some rocks into bread, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that Scripture tells us that man lives by every word from God.

All sorts of ill and demon-possessed people sought Him for healing, and His fame attracted large crowds who followed Him.
Mat.5	When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> saw the crowds, He went up on a mountain, sat down, and began teaching His disciples. He said: Those who hunger for and pursue God's righteousness in humility, even despite persecution, are blessed and they will be rewarded. The merciful, the pure of heart, and the peacemakers will be rewarded too. People who are persecuted because of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will be greatly rewarded. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples are the salt and light of the world, so they need to do good and be seen doing good. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> has come to fulfill the Law and the Prophets, not abolish them. His disciples should obey the Law, and teach others to do the same. Unless they are more righteous than the Pharisees, they will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. If you are angry with someone, or call someone foolish, you are in danger of being condemned to Hell. Therefore, reconcile any disputes before making an offering to God. Settling matters quickly will save you from prison or fines. Looking at a woman lustfully is the same as adultery. It is better to remove the sinful parts of your body then to go to Hell with a whole body. Any man who divorces his wife, except for cases of adultery, causes her to commit adultery. Any man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Do not swear oaths, as doing so is Satanic. Do not seek justice for transgressions against you, but rather let people mistreat you. Give to anyone who asks you for anything. Love and pray for your enemies.
Mat.6	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> continued: Do not do acts of righteousness to be praised by men, but instead go out of your way to do them secretly, and then you will be rewarded by God. Also, pray secretly in order to be rewarded. In prayer, do not babble and chant endlessly, because God already knows your needs. Simply pray for forgiveness, sustenance, protection from Satan, the coming of God's Kingdom, and God's will to be done. Forgive others to be forgiven by God. When you fast, do not show that you are fasting, because then God will reward you. Do not store monetary or materialistic wealth, but instead store treasures in Heaven. If you are focused on Heaven, then you will be full of light. But if you focus on the wealth of this world, you will come to love money and hate God. Do not worry about having food, drink, or clothing, but instead pursue God's Kingdom and righteousness, and God will ensure that you have what you need. Do not even worry about saving for tomorrow.
Mat.7	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> continued: Do not be hypocritical when you judge, because you will be held to the same standard. Do not share sacred knowledge with intractable sinners. Ask God for what you need, and He will give it to you, like any good father would do for his children. You can sum up the Law and the Prophets as this: Do to others what you would have them do to you. Most people will be destroyed because they will not walk the narrow road which leads to life. Beware of false prophets. You will know them by whether or not they do good deeds. Not everyone who calls on <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. That day many people who even prophesied, exorcised, and performed miracles in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' name will be turned away for their evil deeds. Those who do what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> says to do will endure, but those who do not obey will be destroyed. The crowds were amazed at the authority of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' teaching.
Mat.8	Coming down from the mountain, the crowds followed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He was approached by a man with leprosy, begging for healing. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> immediately cured him and told him not to tell anyone, and to make an offering according to the Law. Upon arriving in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink>, a centurion asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to heal his paralyzed servant, but not to bother coming to the centurion's unworthy house to perform the healing. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was astonished in the centurion's faith that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> could perform a remote healing, a faith unmatched by any Jew. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that because of this lack of faith, the Jews will be rejected from the Kingdom of Heaven, and Gentiles will take their places. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then healed the centurion's servant remotely. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s house, and healed his ill mother-in-law. That evening, many ill and demon-possessed came to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and were healed, thereby fulfilling <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s prophesy about the Messiah carrying peoples infirmities and diseases. When the crowd gathered around <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, He prepared to go to the other side of the lake. A Teacher of the Law offered to follow <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> warned that He is going to be continuously on the move. Another disciple asked if he could bury his father before following <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied to him that he should follow <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and let the dead bury their dead. While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and His disciples were crossing the lake, a storm threatened to drown them all, so the disciples panicked. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> rebuked them for having little faith, and then (to their amazement) calmed the storm with commands. Arriving on the other side of the lake, two demon-possessed men yelled at <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for coming to torture them before the appointed time, and begged to be cast out into a herd of swine. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sent them into the swine herd, and the herd immediately committed suicide by drowning in the lake. The pig tenders and the rest of the town asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to leave their region.
Mat.9	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> crossed the lake over to His own town (either <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink> or <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler>Nazareth</jLink></jLink></jLink>). When men brought a paralytic man to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, he told the paralytic man that his sins were forgiven. The Teachers of the Law thought that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had blasphemed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then told the paralytic man to get up and walk, which the man did. This proved that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had the authority to forgive sins. The crowd praised God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the tax collector <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler>Matthew</jLink></jLink></jLink> to follow Him, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler>Matthew</jLink></jLink></jLink> did so. While at <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3156' clickHandler>Matthew</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s house eating dinner, the Pharisees protested because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was eating with sinners. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the Pharisees that the sick are the ones who need a doctor, that they should learn that God desires mercy, not sacrifice, and that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> has come to call the sinners, not the righteous. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist's disciples asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> why <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples did not fast, to which <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that they will fast when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> is taken from them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that nobody patches old clothes with new fabric, or puts new wine into old wineskins, because the old fabric would be torn again and the old wineskins would burst. While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that, a ruler arrived and then pleaded for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to come resurrect his recently dead daughter. While headed to heal the ruler's daughter, a hemorrhaging woman touched <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' cloak in the hope of being healed by it. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> turned to the woman and told her that her faith has healed her. When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> arrived at the ruler's house, He grabbed the ruler's daughter's hand, which brought her back to life. News spread of the resurrection in that region. Departing from there, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was confronted by two blind men who believed that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> could heal them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> did heal them by touching their eyes, but told them to keep it a secret. The blind men told everybody anyway. As the formerly-blind men were leaving, a mute, demon-possessed man was brought to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> promptly cast out the demon, which impressed the crowd but caused the Pharisees to accuse <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> of using Satan's power. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, with His disciples, traveled throughout the towns of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink> preaching, teaching, and healing these “sheep without a shepherd.” <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told His disciples to ask God for more harvesters (metaphorical) for these people.

Let the people you help care for your needs. If a town or individual household will not listen to you, shake its dust off your sandals, because that place will be condemned on the Day of Judgement. Be shrewd, but innocent. Guard against hostile men. If you are brought before the authorities, God will speak through you in your defence. Family members will betray other family members to death, but standing firm will yield Salvation. If you are persecuted, flee to another place. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will come before they are done going through the towns of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Mat.11	After sending out the Twelve Disciples, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> taught and preached in the towns of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist heard of this while he was in prison, and sent some of his disciples to ask <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> if He was the awaited Messiah. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied for the disciples to tell <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist about how <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was healing and resurrecting people, as well as teaching the poor, and to say that men who do not reject God because of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> are blessed. As <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist's disciples were leaving, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the crowd that they went to see <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist because he is a great prophet, but he is also the one prophesied to prepare the way before God; <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Yet even the best man on earth is lesser than anyone in the Kingdom of Heaven, so bold men are doing whatever they can to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. This generation is like a bunch of fickle children; claiming that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist is demon-possessed and calling <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> (the Son of Man) a drunken glutton whose friends are sinners and tax collectors, but wisdom is proven by actions. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> denounced Korazin, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0966' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0966' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0966' clickHandler>Bethsaida</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink> for not repenting despite His miracles, proclaiming that they will receive unbearable punishment on the Day of Judgement. At that time <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> praised God the Father for hiding the true knowledge of God from those who think that they have everything figured out. God the Father is only revealed to whomever <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> chooses. You should come to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> because His burden is light and He will give you rest for your soul.
Mat.12	At that time <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and His disciples walked through grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples picked and ate some grain. Pharisees saw this and said that they were breaking the Law. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink> was hungry, he broke the Law and ate sacred bread, that Priests break the Law by working on the Sabbath, and that they should learn that God desires mercy, not sacrifice. Besides, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> is the ruler of the Sabbath. From there, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to the synagogue belonging to those Pharisees, where <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath, and then healed a man with a shriveled hand in front of them. This made them plot to kill <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> fled because He was aware of their plot. He healed those who followed Him. This fulfilled <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s prophesy regarding God putting His spirit on His servant, who would peacefully proclaim justice to the nations. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> exorcised the demon in a blind, mute man, but the Pharisees claimed that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> did this through Beelzebub's (Satan's) power. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that if Satan is casting out demons, then Satan's kingdom will not stand, and asked them by whose power they perform exorcisms. If <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> is casting out <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> by God's Spirit, then the Kingdom of God is here. Besides, who can rob a strong man without tying up the strong man? Anyone not supporting <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> is against Him. Blaspheming God's Spirit is the one unforgivable sin. Good people are known by the good they do, and likewise with evil people like the Pharisees. People will be held accountable on the Day of Judgement for every careless word they have said, and acquitted or condemned accordingly. Then some Pharisees and Teachers of the Law asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to perform a miracle, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that only a wicked generation asks for a sign, and that no sign will be given other than <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> being in the “heart of the earth” for three days and nights. The repentant men of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5210' clickHandler>Nineveh</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the Queen of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7614J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7614J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7614J' clickHandler>Sheba</jLink></jLink></jLink> will condemn this generation. This generation will be like a man who had a demon exorcised from him, only to have the demon come back to inhabit that man along with seven more-wicked spirits. While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was speaking to the crowd, someone informed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' mother and brothers were outside waiting to speak to Him, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that His real family are His disciples; people who obey the will of God the Father.
Mat.13	That same day, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sat in a boat on the lake shore while a crowd gathered. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> gave a parable where a farmer indiscriminately sowed seeds in different places, but ultimately only the seeds sown in good soil produced any substantial crop. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples asked Him why He spoke to the crowds in parables. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that only certain people, like the disciples, will be given knowledge of the Kingdom of Heaven, but the crowds are not chosen to receive that knowledge, and these crowds will even lose whatever they have. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He speaks in parables so that these crowds will not understand, which was according to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s prophesy about people hearing and seeing without understanding or perceiving. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> called His disciples blessed for hearing and seeing, and then explained that in the parable, the different places where the seeds were sown represent different reactions to God's word; Satan robs some people of understanding, others are joyous at first but soon falter in following God due to persecution, others are joyous at first but get distracted by life and seduced by money, and meanwhile those who truly hear and understand God's word produce good works. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the crowd another parable. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who sowed wheat in a field, but his enemy secretly sowed weeds in that same field. The farmer, not wanting to damage the wheat, let the weeds grow too until harvest time. The farmer then first collected the weeds and burned them, and then next collected the wheat. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the crowd a couple more parables; one that the Kingdom of Heaven was like a tiny mustard seed which grew into a large plant, the other that the Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast mixed into a large amount of dough. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> did not say anything to the crowd except parables, which fulfilled the prophesy about God speaking in parables to reveal hidden things. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> left the crowd and, at the request of the disciples, explained the parable about the wheat and the weeds. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the farmer, the wheat seeds were the “sons of the Kingdom,” the field was the world, Satan was the enemy and the weeds were Satan's sons, and at the “end of the age” everything that causes sin and everyone who does evil will be gathered up by angels and burned in the furnace where they will suffer, and then the righteous will shine. The Kingdom of Heaven is worth giving up all you that have now to get it, like a treasure in a field or a great pearl. The Kingdom of Heaven at the “end of the age” will be like a big fishing net, where angels will separate out the good fish (the righteous) from the bad fish (the wicked), casting the bad ones into the furnace where they will suffer. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples understood these parables, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that those instructed about the Law and the Kingdom of Heaven will bring forth both old and new treasures. After speaking these parables, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler>Nazareth</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but He did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith, because prophets are not honored in their home towns.
Mat.14	When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> heard about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> working miracles, he thought that it was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist who had come back to life. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> had put <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist in prison for speaking out against <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> marrying his brother's wife, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler>Herodias</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Then, recently <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> had <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist decapitated due to a hasty oath given to the daughter of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler>Herodias</jLink></jLink></jLink> for dancing so pleasurably. When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had learned of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist's decapitation, He took a boat ride alone. Meanwhile crowds gathered and followed Him by the shore. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed their sick upon coming back to the shore. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples feared that the crowd, about 5000 men, plus women and children, needed to go get some food. Instead, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> took the five loaves of bread and two fish that the disciples had, broke the bread into pieces, and had the disciples distribute the pieces. After everyone had finished eating, the disciples collected twelve basketfuls of leftover bread pieces. Immediately <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sent His disciples on a boat across the lake. After dismissing the crowd, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> prayed alone on a mountain.

Someone who causes people to sin will have a fate much worse than drowning. If any part of your body causes you to sin, it is better to dismember it and enter life maimed than to have a whole body and be cast into the eternal fires of Hell. Watch how you treat children because their angels are always in front of God. A man who has one hundred sheep will leave the flock to recover one which wanders away, and be very happy about recovering that one. God is the same way, not willing to lose any children. If your brother sins against you, try to resolve the matter privately, then if necessary use witnesses, then if necessary go to the church. If he still does not listen, treat him like a pagan or a tax collector. You decide what is bound up or loosened on earth and in Heaven. Anything two or more people ask for from God will be done, and God will be with them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked how many times he should forgive his brother. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied to forgive seventy-seven times. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the parable of a servant who was forgiven a large debt, but then demanded recompense from those who had borrowed from him. Upon hearing about this, the master who had forgiven the man's large debt, angered by the man's lack of likewise mercy, turned him over to jailers to be tortured until he could pay back that original debt. This is how God will treat you if you do not forgive others in your heart.

The greatest person will be one who becomes a humble servant. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then condemned the Pharisees and Teachers of the Law to Hell because they prevent people from entering the Kingdom of Heaven, they go to great lengths bring people to God but then mislead them, they do not understand the ramifications of swearing by Holy objects, they follow the minute details of the Law but do not practice justice, mercy, and faithfulness, they worry about the cleanliness of their dishes when they have greed and self-indulgence on their own insides, and they appear to be righteous but are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. They claim that they would not have persecuted God's prophets in the earlier times, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will send out prophets who they will persecute and kill, thereby proving them to be hypocrites and casting on them blood guilt from back to that of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1893' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1893' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1893' clickHandler>Abel</jLink></jLink></jLink> up to that of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148w' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148w' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H2148w' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and this all will happen to this generation. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then mourned for <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, because He had tried many times to gather them, but they were not willing. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will leave them until they are welcoming to someone who comes in God's name.
Mat.24	As <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was leaving the Temple, He told His disciples that every stone of the Temple would be thrown down. At the Mount of Olives, His disciples asked Him what signs would there be of His Second Coming and the end of the age. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that there would be many false Messiahs who would mislead many people, and there would be wars, famines, and earthquakes in the beginning of the end. Then the disciples will be persecuted and put to death, and many of the faith will fall away and turn on each other, and false prophets will deceive many, but those who stand firm until the end will be Saved. The Gospel will be taught to the whole world, and then the end will come. When you see the abomination in the Temple which was prophesied by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1840G' clickHandler>Daniel</jLink></jLink></jLink>, you should flee immediately, because there will then come a time of distress which is greater than any in history or any yet to come. In fact, if God did not plan on shortening those days for the Elect, nobody would survive. Do not believe the false prophets and their miraculous signs, who would deceive even the Elect if that was possible. By contrast, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will come back like lightening; seen by everyone. Immediately after that distressful time, the sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars will fall. It is then that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will appear in the sky, with great power and glory. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' angels will then gather the Elect. Just like you know that summer is near when leaves sprout on a fig tree, so will these signs show you that the end is imminent. All of these things will happen during this generation. Only God knows the exact day and hour when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will return. His return will take people by surprise, just like the flood of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> surprised people back then. Therefore, you should be in constant readiness and should keep your deeds righteous, because if <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> comes back to find you acting wickedly, He will cast you out with the hypocrites.
Mat.25	At that time, the Kingdom of Heaven will be like this: Ten virgins grabbed some oil lamps to await their bridegroom. Five of them thought to bring extra oil in case they needed it. The bridegroom took a long time coming, so the five without extra oil ran out of it by the time he showed up. They went to buy more oil, but while they were gone the five with the extra oil went into the wedding banquet with the bridegroom. Those late virgins were then rejected when they finally got to the banquet. The Kingdom of Heaven will also be like this: A master, who was going on a trip, entrusted different amounts of money to each of his three servants according to their abilities. By the time the master returned, two of the servants had doubled the money, and so the master rewarded their productivity. However, the third servant had only hidden the entrusted money away for safe keeping, so he returned only what the master had given to him. The master was angry with this servant, called him lazy for not putting the money in the bank to gain interest, took the money from the "lazy" servant and gave it to the richest servant, and tossed the "lazy" servant out into the darkness. When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> comes back, He will judge everyone. Those people who were generous, friendly to strangers, and compassionately caring will be granted eternal life. Those people who were not generous, friendly to strangers, and compassionately caring will receive eternal punishment.

The High Priest, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler>Caiaphas</jLink></jLink></jLink>, met with other Priests and Elders to have <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> arrested and killed, but they did not want to do so during the Feast for fear that the people might riot. At <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613I' clickHandler>Simon</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Leper's house in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0963' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0963' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0963' clickHandler>Bethany</jLink></jLink></jLink>, a woman poured expensive perfume on <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' head. His disciples gawked at the waste of money which could have been given to the poor. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that the poor would always be around, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> would soon be gone, and her anointing has prepared Him for burial. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler>Judas</jLink></jLink></jLink> Iscariot went to the Chief Priests and worked out a deal to hand over <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for arrest for thirty silver coins. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told His disciples to prepare the Passover feast at a certain man's house. While they were eating the Passover Feast, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> announced that one of the Twelve Disciples would betray Him, and while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' life must fulfill prophesy, woe will be to the one who betrays Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> confirmed to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler>Judas</jLink></jLink></jLink> that it was him who would betray <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> broke bread and distributed it, calling it His body. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> took a glass of wine and passed it around, calling it His blood, and said He would not drink wine again until doing so in the Kingdom of God. They all sang a hymn and then went to the Mount of Olives. There, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told His disciples that they would fall away from Him that night. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that he would never fall away, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him that he would disown <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> three times before the rooster crowed.

The armed men arrested <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. One of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples pulled out a sword and attacked the High Priest's servant, cutting off his ear. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told that disciple to stop the attack, because He could be defended by angels if necessary, but what is happening must happen to fulfill Scriptures. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> rebuked the armed men for arresting Him like He was the leader of a rebellion. All of the disciples fled. The armed men took <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to an assembly of the Sanhedrin where the High Priest (<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler>Caiaphas</jLink></jLink></jLink>), Chief Priests, Teachers of the Law, and Elders. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>, staying a safe distance away, followed them to find out what would happen. The Sanhedrin tried to get <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sentenced to death, but the false witnesses did not have enough false evidence. Two witnesses said that they heard <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> say that He could destroy and rebuild the Temple of God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said nothing in His defence. The High Priest asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> if He was the Messiah, the Son of God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> answered that He was, and in the future they would see Him at seated God's right hand and coming on the clouds. With this, they accused <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> of blasphemy, said He should die, and began mocking Him. Meanwhile, while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> waited in the courtyard, three times people identified him as one of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' companions, but he denied knowing <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> each time. Right after the third denial, a rooster crowed, reminding <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' words, and so he wept bitterly.

It was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s custom to release a prisoner at the Feast, so he offered the crowd to release either <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> or a man named <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler>Barabbas</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Then, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s wife told him not to do anything to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> because of a dream she had about Him. Meanwhile, the Priests and Elders convinced the crowd to ask for the release of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler>Barabbas</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and to ask for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to be crucified. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> tried unsuccessfully to get the crowd to change their minds, so he washed his hands in front of the crowd, and told them that he was innocent of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' blood. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> released <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler>Barabbas</jLink></jLink></jLink> and had <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> flogged and sent for crucifixion. The soldiers took <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, put a crown of thorns on His head, and proceeded to mock, spit upon, and beat him, before leading Him to the crucifixion. On the way, the soldiers forced a man from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2956' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2956' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2956' clickHandler>Cyrene</jLink></jLink></jLink> to carry the cross. Upon reaching <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1115' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1115' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1115' clickHandler>Golgotha</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the soldiers offered <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> wine mixed with gall to drink, but He refused after tasting it. They crucified Him between to robbers, with a sign above His head reading "THIS IS <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>JESUS</jLink></jLink></jLink>, THE KING OF THE JEWS." They divided up His clothing by lot. The Chief Priests, Teachers of the Law, Elders, and other passers by all mocked, insulted, and taunted Him. Even the robbers who were crucified with Him insulted Him too. From noon to three in the afternoon, darkness came over the land. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> cried out to God, asking why God had forsaken Him. Some nearby thought He called to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Someone then offered Him wine vinegar to drink from a sponge. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> cried out again, and then died. At that moment, the Temple's curtain was torn, there was an earthquake, and dead bodies came out of their tombs and went into <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The centurion and other soldiers guarding <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> were scared by these signs, and so then believed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to be the Son of God. Women had been watching from a distance. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink> from Arimathea went to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> to ask to have <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' body, which <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> willingly gave to him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink> put <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' body in his own tomb, and rolled a rock in front of it, while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> Magdalene and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the mother of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385H' clickHandler>James</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink>, watched him do that. The next day, a Sabbath day, the Pharisees persuaded <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> to set a guard in front of the tomb for three days to prevent <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' followers from stealing the body and claiming that He had been resurrected.
Mat.28	The day after the Sabbath, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> Magdalene and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137K' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the mother of James and Joseph, went to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' tomb. There was an earthquake, and an angel who looked like lightening in pure white clothes came and rolled back the stone, scaring the guards and causing them to faint. The angel told the women that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had risen, and told them to tell the Disciples that He would meet with them in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. On the way back to tell the Disciples, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> met the women. They worshiped Him. He told them to tell the disciples that He would meet them in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Meanwhile, the guards reported what had happened to the Chief Priests. The Chief Priests bribed the guards with a lot of money, so the guards then officially reported that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' body was taken in the middle of the night while the guards were asleep, which is the story told by the Jews today. The eleven Disciples met with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> on a mountain in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>, where they worshiped Him, but some doubted. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them to go and baptize all nations and teach them to obey Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> would be with them to the end of the age.
Mrk.1	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> prophesied about a messenger preparing the way for God, and John the Baptist was that messenger; preaching repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins. People all over <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink> came to be baptized by him in the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler>Jordan</jLink></jLink></jLink> River. He wore camel-hair clothing and a leather belt, and ate honey and locusts. His message was about the one to come; one who would instead baptize with the Holy Spirit. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> came from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler>Nazareth</jLink></jLink></jLink> and was baptized by John the Baptist. As <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was coming up out of the water, the Holy Spirit descended to Him, and God spoke from Heaven, saying that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was His beloved Son. The Spirit led <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> into the desert, where He was tempted by Satan for forty days, and helped by animals and angels. When John the Baptist was put in prison, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> began preaching that the time for the Kingdom of Heaven is near. Walking by the Sea of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> effortlessly recruited the fishermen Simon (<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>), his brother <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0406' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0406' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0406' clickHandler>Andrew</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and the brothers John and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler>James</jLink></jLink></jLink>, to be Disciples. In <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> taught in a synagogue on the Sabbath, impressing others with His apparent authority. An evil-spirit-possessed man asked if <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the Holy One of God, had come to destroy them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> commanded the spirit to be quiet and to come out of the man, which it did. News of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' teaching and exorcism quickly spread throughout <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. They went from the synagogue to Simon's home. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed Simon's sick mother-in-law. The whole town gathered outside the house after sunset, where <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed people and performed more exorcisms; preventing the demons from speaking so that they would not identify Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> prayed early the next morning, and then they all started traveling together to the villages in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink> so that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> could preach. He also performed more exorcisms. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed a man with leprosy, told him to offer the legal sacrifices for his cleansing, and instructed him to keep the healing a secret, but the man instead spread the news.

Mrk.2	A few days later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> returned to His home in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink>, where He preached to the thick crowds that gathered at His door. Some men brought a paralyzed man to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, tearing a hole in the roof in order to get the man in front of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the man that his sins were forgiven, which upset the Teachers of the Law. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, knowing their thoughts, rebuked them, and proved to them that He could forgive sins by healing the paralyzed man. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went back to the Sea of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>, where He effortlessly recruited Levi, a tax-collector, as a Disciple. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> ate dinner at Levi's house, with other tax collectors and sinners, which upset the Pharisees. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the Pharisees that it is the sick who need a doctor. Some people asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> why His disciples did not fast. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that they would fast when He was gone, and said that no one patches clothes with unshrunk fabric or puts new wine into old wineskins. One Sabbath, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples picked grain and ate it, upsetting the Pharisees, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> reminded the Pharisees how <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his companions illegally ate the consecrated bread because they were hungry. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> further told them that the Sabbath was made for man, and that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> is the Lord of the Sabbath.
Mrk.3	In a synagogue on another Sabbath, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked the Pharisees which it was legal to do on a Sabbath: good or evil, but they did not answer. Angry at them, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then healed a man's shriveled hand. The Pharisees and Herodians then sought out a way to kill <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and His disciples went back to the Sea of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Crowds from all of the surrounding nations gathered to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to be healed and exorcised. The demons announced that He was the Son of God, but He told them to be quiet. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> selected twelve of His disciples, brought them up on a mountain, and appointed them as Apostles; to follow Him, to go out and preach, and to have power over demons. Later, another thick crowd gathered while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was in a house, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' family went to seize Him because they thought that He was crazy. Teachers of the Law from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> accused <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> of being able to cast out demons because He was possessed by Beelzebub. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> countered that Satan cannot drive out Satan, rather Satan must be first bound up to be robbed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> added that people who blaspheme the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' family arrived, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> ignored them, claiming that those who do God's will are His family.
Mrk.4	Later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> taught people through parables while standing in a boat just off the shore of the Sea of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He told them a parable about how a farmer who sowed seeds indiscriminately, but only the seeds which fell in good soil produced a bountiful crop. Later when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was alone with the Twelve Disciples, He explained that the secret of the Kingdom of God is hidden from people on the outside, and so He taught in parables to keep the outsiders from understanding so that they would not repent, as it was prophesied. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> chastised them for not understanding the parable of the sower, and then explained it to them: The seed is the word of God, and for some Satan steals the word, others accept it superficially, others accept it but get distracted by the cares of this world, but some accept it and are fruitful with it. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said to the crowds: Lamps are put on stands to reveal things, so whatever is hidden will be fully disclosed. Whatever standards people judge by will be applied to them. Those who have much will be given more, but those who have little will be robbed. The Kingdom of God is like grain which grows by itself and then gets harvested. The Kingdom of God is like the tiny mustard seed which grows into the largest of garden plants. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> spoke only in parables to the outsiders, but explained the parables to the Disciples when they were alone. That day He gathered the Disciples into the boat with Him, and the headed to the other side of the Sea of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> took a nap in the boat. Meanwhile a heavy storm that threatened to swamp the boat. The Disciples awakened <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who then calmed the storm by command and rebuked them for their lack of faith.
Mrk.5	When they got to the other side, in Gerasenes, a man possessed with a legion of demons approached <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, yelled that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the Son of God, and begged not to be tortured. Granting the request of the demons, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sent them into a heard of 2000 pigs, which then drowned themselves. The people of that region asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to leave, so He did. The formerly-demon-possessed man asked to go with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but He told him to instead share his testimony of God's mercy on him. When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> made it back to the other side of the Sea of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>, a synagogue ruler, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler>Jairus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, pleaded with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to heal his deathly ill daughter, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went with him. On His way to see the daughter, a woman with chronic bleeding touched <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' cloak in the hopes that it would heal her, and it did. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> turned around to identify her, and told her that her faith had healed her. While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was speaking, men informed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler>Jairus</jLink></jLink></jLink> that his daughter had died, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler>Jairus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to believe, and continued on to see the girl. Once there, He took the girl's hand and told her to get up, and she did. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> strictly warned them not to tell anyone about this.
Mrk.6	From there, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to His hometown, where He taught in the synagogue on the Sabbath, and people were amazed at His knowledge. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said a prophet is not honored by his family or in his hometown. He could only perform a few healing miracles there. Later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sent out the Twelve Disciples in pairs to preach repentance, exorcise demons, and heal people; and if any place would not receive them, they were to condemn that place. King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> had heard of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sending the Disciples out and of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' powers, so he thought that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist resurrected, while others thought that He was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> or another prophet. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> had arrested <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist for rebuking <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s marriage to his brother's wife, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler>Herodias</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler>Herodias</jLink></jLink></jLink> wanted <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist dead, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> liked hearing him talk.

After consulting with her mother, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2266G' clickHandler>Herodias</jLink></jLink></jLink>' daughter asked for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist's head on a platter, which <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> begrudgingly supplied. When the Disciples returned from their first mission, they reported their successes. Many people kept coming to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, so He suggested that they get away for a little while for some rest, but when they got in a boat to leave, the crowds followed them on the shore. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> felt compassion for them, and taught them much after returning to shore. It had gotten late, so the Disciples suggested to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> that He send the people away to get food. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> instead suggested that they would feed these people. He took the five loaves of bread and two fish that they had, and with them miraculously fed the five thousand men who had been there, and picked up twelve basketfuls of leftover food.. Afterward, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sent the Disciples away by boat, dismissed the crowd, and prayed on a mountainside. By the evening, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and the Disciples were struggling against a strong wing. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> began walking across the lake, scaring the Disciples as He approached. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them not be afraid, and then climbed into the boat. The wind calmed down. The Disciples were amazed because they had not understood <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' power from the miraculous feeding. When they reached <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1082' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1082' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1082' clickHandler>Gennesaret</jLink></jLink></jLink>, news spread and people brought sick people to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for healing, as also happened wherever He went.
Mrk.7	According to Jewish custom, they always ceremonially washed their hands before eating. Pharisees and Teachers of the Law from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> why His Disciples did not wash their hands. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> rebuked them, saying that as <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3470A' clickHandler>Isaiah</jLink></jLink></jLink> had said, they follow the customs of men instead of God's laws. For example, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> pointed out how they disobey God's law to kill children who dishonor their parents as long as the children honor God instead. He then said that it is what a comes out of a man, not anything outside of a man, which makes him unclean. His Disciples privately asked for an explanation of this. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that what a man speaks comes from his heart, and so evil speech can make a man unclean. From there, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went on to the region of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H6865' clickHandler>Tyre</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and was discovered by a Greek woman with a demon-possessed daughter. The Greek woman begged for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to exorcise her daughter, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that such healing "bread" was not fit for dogs. The woman insisted that dogs will eat the crumbs dropped from the table. This impressed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, so He exorcised the demon. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> traveled back to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>, in the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1179' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1179' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1179' clickHandler>Decapolis</jLink></jLink></jLink> region. There, a deaf and partially mute man was brought to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for healing. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> put His fingers in his ears, spit, and touched his tongue, and that healed the man. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them to keep the healing a secret, but they did not do so.
Mrk.8	A crowd of about 4000 men, with no food, had followed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> in a remote area for three days, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> compassionately wanted feed them before sending them back home. His disciples balked at that idea, because they only had seven bread loaves and a few small fish. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> took the bread and the fish, gave thanks, broke them up, and had His disciples distribute the pieces. Everyone ate, and the disciples then picked up seven basketfuls of leftover pieces. After dismissing the crowd, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and His disciples went to the region of Dalmanutha by boat. There, Pharisees prodded <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for a sign from Heaven, but He said there would be no sign, and then He and His party got back in the boat and left. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> warned His disciples about the yeast of the Pharisees, and that of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

The disciples would be arrested, and flogged and would speak words that the Holy Spirit provided them in front of governors and kings. The Gospel will first be preached to all nations. Family members will kill one another, and the Disciples will be hated. Those who stand firm to the end will be Saved. When they see an "abomination that causes desolation," they should flee because a time of great distress, greater than has ever been or ever will be, is coming. No one would survive if it was not for the fact that God will shorten that time for the sake of the Elect. Do not be deceived by the false Christs who will perform miracles in that time. After that distress, the sun and moon will go dark and the stars will fall. Then everyone will see <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> come with power, sending His angels to gather the Elect. When you start to see these things happen, the end will be near, and it will happen before this present generation dies.

Some people rebuked her for this wasted money, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> defended her, saying that, unlike the poor, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> would not always be there, and that the anointing was for His burial. Then, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler>Judas</jLink></jLink></jLink> left and made a deal with the Chief Priests to betray <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told a couple of His Disciples to make preparations for the Feast with a man in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> who was carrying a jar of water. That evening while eating the Feast, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> announced that one of the Disciples would betray Him, and it would have been better for him if he had not been born. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> gave thanks, broke some bread, gave it to the Disciples, and said that it was His body. Then He gave thanks, shared a cup of wine, and said that it was His blood of the covenant, and that He would not drink wine again until the when the Kingdom of God came. On the Mount of Olives, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that, as prophesied, the Disciples would all desert Him in His death, but He would meet them in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink> when He was resurrected. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> denied that he would leave <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that he would deny knowing Him three times before the rooster crowed twice the next morning. They went to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1068' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1068' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1068' clickHandler>Gethsemane</jLink></jLink></jLink>, where <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> took <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler>James</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> to stand watch while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> prayed to God to change <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' coming fate, if that was alright with God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> returned and found the three Disciples asleep, so He scolded <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then went and prayed for the same thing, and came back to find the Disciples asleep again. The same thing happened again, and this time <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> announced that His betrayer was here. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler>Judas</jLink></jLink></jLink> showed up with armed men, and identified <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to them by kissing Him. Someone cut off an armed man's ear. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> mocked the men for their aggressive armaments. Everyone who had been with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> fled. They took <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to an impromptu Sanhedrin trial in front of the High Priest, the Chief Priests, Elders, and Teachers of the Law, while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> followed at a the distance. Many false charges were brought against <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but the witness statements did not agree. The High Priest asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for a response to the accusations, but He remained silent. Then he asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> if He was the Messiah. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He was, and that they would see Him coming on the clouds of Heaven. At that reply, everyone there condemned <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for His blasphemy, and they mocked Him and beat Him. While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> was waiting outside, one of the High Priest's servant girls accused him of being with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> twice, but he denied it both times. Later someone standing nearby accused him of being with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and he denied it again. The rooster then crowed a second time, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> wept.
Mrk.15	They brought <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> if He was the king of the Jews, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> answered yes. The Chief Priests made many accusations against <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> remained silent, which amazed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink>. It was the custom to release a prisoner at the Feast, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> offered to release <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. However, the Chief Priests convinced the crowd to ask for a different prisoner, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler>Barabbas</jLink></jLink></jLink>, instead. The crowd persistently demanded for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to be crucified. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> released <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0912' clickHandler>Barabbas</jLink></jLink></jLink> and had <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> flogged and sent for crucifixion. The soldiers, who were keeping <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, put a purple robe and a crown of thorns on Him, and then proceeded to mock, spit, and beat Him. Then they dressed Him back in His own clothes and led Him to the crucifixion. They forced a man named <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613J' clickHandler>Simon</jLink></jLink></jLink> from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2956' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2956' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2956' clickHandler>Cyrene</jLink></jLink></jLink> to carry <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' cross.

Then they crucified Him and two robbers at 9 A.M. on the day before a Sabbath, and cast lots for His clothes. The notice of His charges called Him "The King of the Jews." Passers by mocked Him, as did the Chief Priests and Teachers of the Law. Even the robbers crucified with Him insulted Him. From noon to 3 P.M. the whole land was dark, and at 3 P.M. He called out to God for forsaking Him. One man offered wine vinegar on a sponge for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to drink.

Luk.1	Many people have written Gospels about the word. The author has carefully investigated the whole story, and so decided to write an account for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2321' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2321' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2321' clickHandler>Theophilus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to reinforce what he had been taught. In the days when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264G' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> ruled <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink>, there was a priest named <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his wife were old, childless, and had both obeyed God's Law perfectly. While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> was burning incense in the Temple of God, an angel (Gabriel) appeared by the altar, frightening him. Gabriel told him that God would grant his prayer for a son, that that son should be called <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink>, that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> should never drink alcohol, that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> would be filled with the Holy Spirit from birth, and that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> would bring many people of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3478' clickHandler>Israel</jLink></jLink></jLink> back to God in the power and spirit of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, making people prepared for the Lord. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2197H' clickHandler>Zechariah</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked how he could have a child when he was so old. Gabriel told him that because he did not believe, he would be mute until the day that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> is born. After Zachariah's Temple service was complete, he returned home, and his wife (<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler>Elizabeth</jLink></jLink></jLink>) became pregnant. She remained in happy seclusion for five months. In the sixth month, Gabriel visited the virgin <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who was pledged to marry <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501G' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink> (a descendent of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink>), in the town of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3478' clickHandler>Nazareth</jLink></jLink></jLink> in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Gabriel answered that the Holy Spirit would come upon her, overshadowing her with God's power, so that the one born will be called the Son of God. Gabriel added that even her old relative, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler>Elizabeth</jLink></jLink></jLink>, is now pregnant because of God's power. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> said to let it be so. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> then hurried to visit <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler>Elizabeth</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler>Elizabeth</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s baby leaped in her womb when she heard <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and blessed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> for being favored by God to be the one to give birth to the Lord, and for believing what she had been told. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> agrees, saying that she is blessed that God, her Savior, has bestowed such a great honor on her, that He is merciful to those who fear Him, that He lifts up the humble and poor while turning away the prideful and the rich, and that He has remembered His promise to be merciful to the Jews. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> stayed with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler>Elizabeth</jLink></jLink></jLink> for about three months. Eight days after <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G1665G' clickHandler>Elizabeth</jLink></jLink></jLink> had her baby, she and Zachariah took the baby to be circumcised and named. There was some debate over what the baby should be named, but Zachariah wrote that his name would be <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Immediately, Zachariah was able to speak again, and he praised God. All throughout <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink> people were amazed by this story and wondered what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> would become. Zachariah praised God for redeeming His people as He had promised to do, and pronounced that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> would be a great prophet who prepared the way for the Lord and gave people the knowledge of Salvation through forgiveness of their sins. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> grew up strong in the Spirit, living in the desert until his later public appearance.

An angel appeared to some shepherds in a nearby field, announcing the Messiah's birth. Then, many angels joined in and praised God. The shepherds went to see the baby in Bethlehem. When they found Him, they rejoiced and spread the word about what the angel had told them. On the eighth day, the baby was circumcised and given the name <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137G' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> did her after-birth purification ceremony, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was consecrated, per God's Law.

Upon seeing crowds approach him, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked them who had warned them to flee God's coming wrath, and told them that they should produce fruits consistent with repentance or else be thrown into the fire. He instructed them to be generous to those in need if you have more than what you need, to have honest dealings, and be content with your pay. Many people were wondering if <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist was the Messiah, but he told them that the Messiah will come, baptizing with the Holy Spirit and fire; gathering the wheat but burning the chaff. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> arrested <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist for speaking out about his transgressions, including marrying his brother's wife. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was baptized with many other people, and while in prayer afterward, the Holy Spirit came upon Him, and God announced from Heaven that God was happy with His Son, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was thirty years old when He began His ministry.

On the fortieth day, the Devil told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to turn some stones into bread, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> answered that man does not live by bread alone. The Devil then offered <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> all of the kingdoms of earth (which had been given to the Devil) in return for worship, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> answered that you should only worship God.

He told them that the prophesy was now fulfilled. Everyone liked Him. He told them that Prophets are not accepted in their hometowns, and cited the examples of how <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0477' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0477' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0477' clickHandler>Elisha</jLink></jLink></jLink> had helped out non-Israelites. They became angry at this, and tried to throw <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> off a cliff, but He walked right through them. Later <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> taught in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink>, impressing many. The demon in a possessed man screamed at <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and identified Him as the "Holy one of God." <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> commanded the spirit to leave the man, which it promptly did, further impressing the people. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to Simon's house, where He cured Simon's mother-in-law. That evening <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed many other people, and cast out many demons; demons who shouted that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the Son of God. The next morning He prayed alone, and then told the people that He must continue to travel and preach. He went on to preach in the synagogues of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Afterward, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told Simon to go fishing. Simon was reluctant due to poor success the previous day, but he obeyed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Simon caught so many fish that their nets almost broke and the boat almost sank, and he needed the help of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler>James</jLink></jLink></jLink> and John to secure all of the fish. Simon fearfully realized <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' pine nature. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that they would now fish for men, so they left everything to follow Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed a man with leprosy, and then told him not to tell anyone and to offer the sacrifices for cleansing found in the Law. News of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' healings and teachings made him popular, but He often withdrew to be alone. Once while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was teaching in a building and God's healing power was present, some men ripped a hole in the building's roof in order to get their paralyzed friend in front of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the hopes of him being healed. They lowered him on a mat right in front of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> forgave the man's sins, which made the Pharisees and Teachers of the Law indignant. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that the "Son of Man" has the authority to forgive sins, and then healed the man's paralysis as proof of that authority. Everyone was amazed and praised God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the tax collector, Levi, to follow Him, which Levi did immediately. Levi held a feast in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' honor, which made the Pharisees and Teachers of the Law indignant because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> ate with sinners, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that He has come to call sinners to repent. They questioned why His disciples did not fast, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that they would fast when He was gone. He then told them through short parables about patches and wineskins that people who are established in old mindsets cannot accept new teaching.
Luk.6	One Sabbath, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples picked and ate some grain, prompting some Pharisees to question the unlawful act. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that even <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink> had broken the Law when he was hungry, and He told them that He was the Lord of the Sabbath. On another Sabbath, Pharisees and Teachers of the Law hoped to catch <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> illegally healing that day, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked them if it was permitted to do good or evil on the Sabbath. With that question, He then healed a man with a shriveled hand, which made them angry.

He healed many people and all who touched Him. He told His disciples that although they are poor, hungry, and sorrowful now, they will be happy in the Kingdom of God. He also told them that when they are persecuted for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' sake, they should be joyous because they are being treated like the Prophets and will have a great reward in Heaven. However, those who are rich, well fed, laughing, or well respected will be in trouble. Love your enemies, never seek retribution, and be extremely generous with your possessions, even to thieves. Treat everyone how you would like to be treated. Be generous in love and in giving without thoughts of compensation, and then you will be like God, and He will richly reward you. Be merciful. You will be treated by God the same way that you treat others, so be generous and not judgemental. A student can only become as good as his teacher. Do not be hypocritical in pointing out the faults of others. What you do shows whether you are good or evil. If you do not do what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> says, you are headed toward disaster.

Everyone acknowledged that God's way was right, except for the Pharisees and Experts of the Law (they had not been baptized by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink>). <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that that generation was like fickle children who are never satisfied because they rejected the different approaches of both <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. While dining at a Pharisee's house, a formerly-sinful woman wept on <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' feet, wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and then put perfume on them. The Pharisee became indignant that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> let her touch Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4613I' clickHandler>Simon</jLink></jLink></jLink> through questioning that someone forgiven of very much will be very loving, and said that this woman had been forgiven of much and so loved Him a lot. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the woman that her sins were forgiven and her faith had Saved her.

Many women who <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had healed traveled with them as well, supporting them with their own money, including Mary Magdalene, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2489' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2489' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2489' clickHandler>Joanna</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4677' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4677' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4677' clickHandler>Susanna</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was building a large following. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the Parable of the Sower, where seeds were cast on different soils, but only the good soil was productive. The Disciples asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for the meaning of the parable. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that only they were given the secret knowledge of the Kingdom of God, but He spoke in parables to others so that they would not understand, thereby fulfilling prophesy. He then said that the various soils in the parable represented how well people receive the word and take it to heart, and that only certain people will be fruitful with the word. However, all will be revealed, and those who have understanding will be given more, but those with no understanding will lose even what little they have. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' mother and brothers came looking for Him while He was in a crowded building, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> reacted by replying that His family were those who put God's word into practice. Once while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the Disciples crossed a lake, a sudden harsh storm threatened the boat. They woke <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> up in a panic, and He promptly commanded the storm to be calm and asked the Disciples where their faith was. This made the Disciples marvel at His power. On the other side of the lake, in the region of Gerasenes, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> encountered a man possessed by a legion of demons who cried out for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the Son of God, not to torture them.

The men who were tending the pig herd told the town what had happened, and the townsfolk then asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to leave because they were afraid of Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the cured man to go home and tell about what God had done for him. When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> arrived back on the other side of the lake to a warm welcome, a synagogue ruler named <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler>Jairus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to come heal his deathly ill daughter. On the way there, a woman with a hemorrhaging problem was cured by touching <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' cloak. After identifying her, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told her that her faith had healed her. Then a messenger came to say that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler>Jairus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' daughter was dead, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2383' clickHandler>Jairus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to believe and his daughter would be healed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the mournful crowd that the girl was really just asleep, and He took <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler>James</jLink></jLink></jLink> with Him into the house, where He then resurrected the girl and told her parents not to tell anyone about what had happened.

Heal people. Take nothing with them. Condemn towns which do not welcome them. The Disciples did so. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink>, having beheaded John the Baptist, was wondering who was responsible for what was happening, and sought out to meet <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

In late afternoon, the Disciples encouraged <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to send the crowd away so they could eat, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the Disciples that they would feed the crowd of about 5000 men. Taking all the Disciples had, five loaves of bread and two fish, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> gave thanks, broke them, and gave the pieces to the Disciples to distribute to the crowd. Afterward, the Disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of leftovers. Sometime later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked His Disciples who the crowds thought that He was.

He then revealed that He would be rejected, killed, and resurrected on the third day. He went on to say that followers of Himself will pick up their cross daily and not be ashamed of Him, and then they will be rewarded, and that some of them would still be alive when they saw the Kingdom of God.

There, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' face changed and His clothes turned glowing white, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> appeared and spoke to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> about what He would soon fulfill in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>, John, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler>James</jLink></jLink></jLink> had been asleep, but awoke to find <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> speaking to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and after had they left <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> suggested setting up three tents to honor them. While <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> was speaking, a cloud of God enveloped them, and it announced that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was God's chosen Son and that they should listen to Him. The three Disciples kept this a secret. The next day, at the base of the mountain a man begged <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to heal his possessed son, who the other Disciples had failed to help in their attempts. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> rebuked that unbelieving generation, and then exorcised the demon. He then revealed to His Disciples that He would be betrayed, but understanding was hidden from them. An argument started among the Disciples over who would be the greatest, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that welcoming a child welcomes Him, and that the greatest among them is the least. John asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> about a non-disciple driving out spirits in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' name, saying that they had tried to stop him, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told John that whoever is not against you is for you. It was now time for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to head toward <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He sent people to a Samaritan town in His path to prepare them, but they rejected Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2385G' clickHandler>James</jLink></jLink></jLink> and John suggested calling fire from the sky to consume the town, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> rebuked them. Along their trek, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> warned a man who wanted to follow that He had no home to go to. Another man said that he would follow after he had buried his father, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him to let the dead bury the dead. Another man said that he would follow after he said goodbye to his family, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him that anyone who looked back is not fit for the Kingdom of God.
Luk.10	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> sent out 72 disciples in pairs to the other towns in His path. He instructed them to pray for more workers, to not to bring money or sandals, to stay in houses that welcome them, to eat what they are given, to heal the sick, to tell people that the Kingdom of God is near, and to condemn entire towns to a fate worse than <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s if the towns do not welcome them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then expressed woe for the horrible fate awaiting Korazin, <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0966' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0966' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0966' clickHandler>Bethsaida</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink> for not believing despite the miracles that had been worked there. People vicariously accept or reject <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> when they accept or reject those which He sends. The 72 returned, glad that they could control demons. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that while they will not be harmed and they can control the demonic forces of the enemy, they should rejoice more at their Salvation. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> thanked God because He had hid understanding from wise people, and because Salvation is only revealed to whom <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> wants to reveal it. He then told His disciples how fortunate they were. Once, a Law expert asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> about how to inherit eternal life. It was clear that you needed to completely love God, and to love your neighbor as yourself, but the expert questioned who was meant by "neighbor." <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied with a parable about a man who was mugged and beaten by thugs. The victimized man was ignored and avoided by a priest and a Levite, but a traveling Samaritan helped the man recover. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked which man had been a neighbor to the victim, and the expert replied that the Samaritan had. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> instructed Him to act the same way. Along the way, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> stopped at <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler>Martha</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s house. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler>Martha</jLink></jLink></jLink> busied herself with hosting preparations, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink>, her sister, just sat and listened to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler>Martha</jLink></jLink></jLink> complained to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink> being lazy, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler>Martha</jLink></jLink></jLink> that it was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137J' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink>, not <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3136' clickHandler>Martha</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who was doing the right thing in this case.
Luk.11	One of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples asked Him how to pray. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them to pray to God, for His Kingdom to come, for enough food, for forgiveness, and to avoid temptation. In a few different ways, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them to ask for what they want from God, and they will then receive good things from Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> exorcised a demon, but some people said that he did so through Beelzebub's power and other people asked for a sign from Heaven. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that clearly He had power over Satan, because Satan would not attack himself or let his demons be exorcised. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that if you are not with Him, you are against Him. He then explained that a demon cast out of a person will come back to possess that person and bring 7 more demons with them. A woman blessed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' mom, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said people who obey God's word are blessed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that only the sign of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink> would be given to that generation, and that <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7614J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7614J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H7614J' clickHandler>Sheba</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the Ninevites will condemn that generation for not repenting despite <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> being better than <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H8010' clickHandler>Solomon</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3124' clickHandler>Jonah</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He then explained that nobody hides lamps, that the eyes are lamps of the body, and that they should seek to be completely lighted on the inside. A Pharisee invited <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to dinner, but he was surprised when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> did not wash His hands before eating. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him that the Pharisees clean the outside, but inside they are greedy and wicked, and that they should give their food to the poor and then everything will be clean for them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then condemned the Pharisees for complying with the minutia of the Law but meanwhile neglecting justice and loving God, and for seeking the prestige of men. He told them that they were as good as dead. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then condemned the Law experts for burdening people with the Law without helping them, for honoring the Prophets who their forefathers killed, for taking away knowledge, and for hindering other people from entering the Kingdom of God. From then on, Pharisees and Teachers of the Law besieged <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> with questions to trap Him whenever they could.
Luk.12	A crowd of several thousands gathered around <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He told His Disciples: Do not to be hypocrites like the Pharisees, because everything private will be revealed to all. Fear God, because He can throw you into Hell. God cares about every detail of you. Claim <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> in front of other people, or else He will disown you in front of God. Blaspheme against the Holy spirit is unforgivable. When challenged, God will give you the right words to say. In response to a financial judgement request from someone in the crowd, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> warned about greed, and told a parable to emphasize that you should focus on richness toward God as opposed to financial wealth. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said to His Disciples: Do not worry about the needs of this life, but rather seek God's Kingdom, and then God will fulfill your needs. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> give away your earthly wealth to the poor, and seek instead the permanent treasures of Heaven with your heart. You need to act as though <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> could come back at any moment. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked if that preparedness message was for everyone, or just the Disciples. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied in parables that while the concept applies to everyone, the greatest responsibility falls on those in leadership because they have been given much and should know better.

Then He scorned the crowd for being able to interpret the weather better than they could interpret the [prophesied] time that they were now in, and through a parable He encouraged them to make amends now or else risk getting all of the punishment they deserved.
Luk.13	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained to the crowd that just because horrible things happen to some people does not make them the worst sinners, and that unless they repent, they too will perish. He told them a parable that a fig tree had produced no fruit for three years, and that it would be given one more year to fruit, this time with fertilizer used, or else it will be cut down. One Sabbath <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was teaching in a synagogue, and there he healed a women who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. The synagogue leader protested the Sabbath healing. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that they were hypocrites, because they took care of even the needs of animals on the Sabbath, so why should not a cripple be unbound from Satan on the Sabbath? The leader was humiliated. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained how the Kingdom of God was like a tiny mustard seed that grows into a large plant, and like yeast which spreads throughout dough. Once, while traveling through towns and villages, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> confirmed that only a few people would be Saved, and even some people who think that they will be Saved will be disowned by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> cast outside the Kingdom instead. People will come from all around to enter the Kingdom, but it is the humble and lowly who will enter, not the proud and the mighty. Pharisees told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2264H' clickHandler>Herod</jLink></jLink></jLink> wanted to kill Him, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He would keep going, and would die in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, just like the other Prophets, in three days. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then lamented how He had longed and often attempted to bring them back to God, but they had refused. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> swore that they would not see Him again until they had changed their ways.
Luk.14	Once, while at a Pharisee's house for dinner on a Sabbath, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed a man with dropsy, and expressed that it was lawful to heal and preserve life on a Sabbath, as even they did so when necessary. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then told the guests that they should not take the seat of honor, or else they risk being embarrassed by the host if there is someone more honorable present. But if they seek the lowest place, then they will truly be honored when the host exalts them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then told the host that he should be inviting the poor and disabled to meals, because even though they cannot repay him, he will then be rewarded at the resurrection of the righteous. Someone at the table replied that blessed is the man who will feast in God's Kingdom. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied with a parable about a man who arranged a big banquet and invited guests, but when the banquet was ready, the invited guests made excuses to not go there. The man got angry, and invited poor, crippled, and lame people to come instead. There was still room, so the man then invited anyone else that could be found, and swore that the original invitees would not taste any of the banquet. Sometime later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the large crowds following Him that they must hate their family, hate their own life, and carry a cross if they want to be a disciple of His. Through two parables, He warned them that they had better be able to give up everything and to be completely committed if they want to be a disciple of His. With a parable about salt, He warned that if you do not do what you should do, you are worthless.
Luk.15	The Pharisees and Teachers of the Law were indignant because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> welcomed tax collectors and sinners. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that if someone loses a sheep, or when someone loses a coin, they will search until they find it, and greatly rejoice when they do; and likewise Heaven rejoices more over the repentance of one sinner than over ninety-nine righteous people. To further explain, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told another parable about a man with two sons, where one son claimed his inheritance early and decided to leave. That son soon spent his wealth and found himself in dire poverty, so he decided to go back and beg for a job from his father. When the father saw him coming, he greatly rejoiced, and honored him with a great feast, because his son had been dead but now was alive. The other, consistently loyal son was angry at the special treatment for his brother because he had not been similarly rewarded for his loyalty. His father explained to the loyal son that he already owned whatever the father has, but it was proper to rejoice at the return of his brother to the family.
Luk.16	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told His disciples a parable about a rich man who had a manager who was wasting his money, and the rich man wanted an explanation. In order to gain favor for when he would lose his job, the manager quickly reduced the debt record of those who owed payments to the rich man. The rich man then commended the manager's shrewd actions. With this, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that you should use your wealth to gain friends and ultimately gain eternal reward. If you cannot do what is right with money, you will not be given the real riches, and you cannot serve both God and money. The Pharisees overheard this teaching, and became indignant, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that God knows their hearts, and He values things differently than men do. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said: The Scriptures were proclaimed until <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist, but now the Kingdom of God is preached and people are forcing their way into it. Nothing can be removed from the Law. A man who divorces and remarries commits adultery, as does a man who marries a divorced woman. A rich man had ignored the beggar, named <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler>Lazarus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, outside his door. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler>Lazarus</jLink></jLink></jLink> died and was taken to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s bosom by angels. The rich man died, and found himself in the torment of Hell. The rich man begged <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> to send <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler>Lazarus</jLink></jLink></jLink> with some water for a little relief from the fire, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him that he was getting what he deserved, and that he could not help him even if he wanted to do so. The rich man then begged for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976G' clickHandler>Lazarus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to go warn the rich man's family about Hell, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that they have their warning from the Scriptures, and if they do not believe the Scriptures, then they would not believe even someone who is resurrected.

Rebuke your brother when he sins, and forgive him as often as he repents. The Apostles asked for <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to increase their faith, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that with a little faith they could command trees to be uprooted. With a parable, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that you should labor for God like a slave without expecting any thanks. In a village between <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> provided delayed healing to ten lepers. One of the ten, a Samaritan, returned to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and thanked Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked where the other nine were. Once <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told a Pharisee that the Kingdom of God was within you. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told His disciples: In the future they will long to see His return, but they should not chase after rumors, because His return will be unmistakably seen by all. But first <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will suffer and be rejected. But <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' return will come as unexpectedly and suddenly as the flood of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5146' clickHandler>Noah</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the destruction of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5467' clickHandler>Sodom</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Then He told a parable about a self-justified Pharisee and a self-humbling tax collector praying at the Temple to illustrate how God favors those who humble themselves, but humbles those who exalt themselves. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> called for children to be brought to Him to illustrate how the Kingdom of God belongs to those who receive it like children. A ruler asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> how to inherit eternal life. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> answered to keep the commandments of do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother. When the ruler said that he had done so, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him to sell everything, give to the poor, and then follow Him.

Then, at the Temple area, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> drove out the merchants. He then taught at the Temple every day. Chief Priests, Teachers of the Law, and other leaders wanted to kill Him, but could not because of how the crowd sought after Him.
Luk.20	Once while <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was teaching in the Temple courtyard, Chief Priests and Teachers of the Law confronted <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, asking what authority He had to teach. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that He would answer them if they would answer if <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist's baptism was man made or God given. They refused to say, knowing the implications against them with either answer. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> refused to answer them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then told the people a parable about a vineyard owner who rented out the vineyard to some tenants. When the owner sent for some fruit at harvest time, the tenants rejected and mistreated the servants he had sent to collect the fruit. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> the owner decided to send his son to collect the fruit, thinking that they would respect him, but the tenants killed him instead. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> this owner will kill the tenants and give the vineyard to others. The people hoped this would never happen, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> quoted Scripture saying that a rejected stone would become the cornerstone, and He said that that stone would crush people. The Chief Priests and Teachers of the Law wanted to arrest <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> because they knew He had spoken the parable against them, so they sent spies to try to entrap <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> by getting Him to say something against the Roman law. The spies asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> if they should pay taxes to Caesar. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that because the coin has Caesar's picture on it, they should give it to him, and that they should give to God what is God's. This answer silenced the spies. Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> who a woman would be married to at the resurrection if she had legally been married to seven brothers in succession according to God's Law. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that those who are worthy of resurrection will be like angels and will not be married. Plus, the Sadducees are mistaken about resurrection, as they ignore that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> recognized that the patriarchs were alive. Some Teachers of the Law were impressed with this answer. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked them why they say that the Messiah is the son of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink> when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink> has called Him Lord. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> warned His disciples against becoming like the Teachers of the Law, because such men will be punished severely for their vanity and lack of mercy.
Luk.21	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> saw rich people giving to the Temple treasury, and then a widow giving two small coins. He then said how the widow had put in far more, because she gave all she had. Some disciples remarked about the splendor of the Temple, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> prophesied that it would be completely torn down. They asked what would be the signs indicating that it was about to happen. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that they should watch out for people claiming to be Him, and that they should not worry about wars that would happen before the end. There would also be earthquakes, famines, pestilences, and other signs from Heaven. But first they would be persecuted and would witness to authorities in the process, with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> giving them words to say. Some of them would be betrayed by family, and some would be killed, but they will gain life through their steadfastness. An army will lay siege to and will desolate <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. It will be a traumatic time. The Gentiles will be in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> until their time is fulfilled. There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and the sea will be very rough; scaring men considerably. Then everyone will see <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> coming on a cloud, and redemption will be near. When trees sprout leaves, you know that summer is near. Similarly, these signs will show that God's Kingdom is near. All of these things will happen before this generation all dies. The end will come unexpectedly, so stay focused and always be ready to stand in front of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> without cause for shame. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> taught each day at the Temple, and stayed each night at the Mount of Olives.

He had them share wine from a cup. Then He broke bread and shared it with them, saying that it was His body, and they should eat it in remembrance of Him. Then after dinner, He took the wine cup and said that it was the New Covenant in His blood. He then said that one of them would betray Him, as it had been decreed. The Apostles wondered which of them would betray <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but then argued over which of them would be the greatest. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that the greatest of them will be a servant to the others, like He is.

Simon replied that he was steadfast, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him that he would deny knowing <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> three times that same day. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them to prepare themselves and get swords, because prophesies about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> were about to be fulfilled.

An angel strengthened Him. He came back and found the disciples sleeping, so He told them to get up and pray to avoid temptation. Then, a crowd appeared, led there by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler>Judas</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> stopped <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler>Judas</jLink></jLink></jLink> from kissing Him.

They seized Him and took Him to the High Priest. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> followed up to the High Priest's courtyard.

This made people watching realize that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was a righteous man. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink> from Arimathea got permission from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4091' clickHandler>Pilate</jLink></jLink></jLink> to bury <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501I' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink> placed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' body in an unused tomb. Some women saw the burial, and planned to come back after the Sabbath to anoint the body.
Luk.24	When the women returned, they found the tomb open and empty. Then two men in glowing clothes appeared and reminded the women that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had said that He would be resurrected. The women told the eleven Apostles about this. They did not believe the women, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> did then go to the tomb and found it empty except for linen wrappings. That day a couple of depressed disciples headed to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1695' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1695' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G1695' clickHandler>Emmaus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> walked with them, but His identity was hidden from them. They told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> about what had happened recently and why they were depressed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> called them fools, then explained in all the Scriptures how <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> and the Prophets had said that the Messiah would be treated this way before achieving glory. They convinced <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to stay with them that night. As <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> broke bread at dinner, they suddenly recognized <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but then He disappeared. The disciples went back and reported this to the Apostles. By then, Simon/<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> had seen <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> too. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> appeared there, scaring them. He told them to touch His flesh and look at His hands to verify that it was Him and not a ghost. He ate some broiled fish. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained to them how everything had been fulfilled in the Law, the Prophets, and Psalms; suffering, resurrection on the third day, repentance and forgiveness preached to the nations in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' name.

Jhn.1	The Word was God and with God, and He made everything, but His true light of life was not understood. God sent John the Baptist to witness about the Light. The Light came into the world, but He was not recognized and was rejected, but those who accepted Him became children of God. The Word became flesh, and we saw His divine glory. God's Law was given through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but grace and truth came from <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

John the Baptist, baptizing in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0963' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0963' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G0963' clickHandler>Bethany</jLink></jLink></jLink> on the other side of the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler>Jordan</jLink></jLink></jLink>, freely confessed that he was neither <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0452G' clickHandler>Elijah</jLink></jLink></jLink> nor the Messiah, but that he was preparing the way for the Lord. When John the Baptist saw <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, he announced that he had seen the Holy Spirit rest on <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, that He was the Son of God, that He would baptize with the Holy Spirit, and that He would take away the world's sin.

Jhn.2	On the third day, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was in Cana at a wedding, where <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' mom asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to help with the shortage of wine. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> turned water into wine in six stone jars. Everyone was impressed with how good the wine tasted. This was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' first miracle in Cana. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, His family, and His disciples went to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> for the Passover holiday. There, He made a whip and chased out the men who were selling animals and changing money in the Temple courts. The Jews asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for a miraculous sign to prove that He had the authority to do this. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that He would destroy this temple and raise it again in three days. (He was referring to His body, and His disciples remembered when He was resurrected that He had said that.) Many people believed in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> because of the miracles He had worked in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> did not need the testimony of men.
Jhn.3	A Pharisee, named <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler>Nicodemus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, came to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> in the night and said that they recognized that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was a teacher sent from God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told him that people need to be born again to see the Kingdom of God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler>Nicodemus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was confused. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said you need to be born of water and spirit to enter the Kingdom of God, that flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit, and that you cannot tell who will be born of the Spirit. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler>Nicodemus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was still confused. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that if he could not understand this, then he could not understand about Heavenly things. Only <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> (the Son of Man) has gone into Heaven. Those who believe in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will have eternal life. God loved the world enough to give His Son to provide Salvation and eternal life to those who believe. Those who do not believe are already condemned. Men love darkness instead of light because they do evil, but the righteous openly show what they have done, because what they have done has been done through God. Then, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went into the Judean countryside with His disciples and baptized people there. This was close to where <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist was also baptizing, and some people with him noted that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was baptizing too and that everyone was going to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist explained to them that he had already told them that he was not Messiah, but rather that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the Messiah, so everyone should go to Him because God has put everything in His hands, and while no one accepts His testimony, those who believe in Him will have eternal life, but those who reject Him will face God's wrath.
Jhn.4	When <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> heard that the Pharisees had heard how popular His baptism service was (although it was only His disciples, not <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, performing the baptisms), He headed back to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. On His way back, He went through the town of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G4965' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G4965' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G4965' clickHandler>Sychar</jLink></jLink></jLink> in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H8111' clickHandler>Samaria</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and came to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler>Jacob</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s well. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked a Samaritan woman to get Him a drink. The woman protested due to the Samaritan/Jewish social norms. Through more dialog, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained to her that she should have known to ask Him for living water which would provide eternal life. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> she then asked Him for that water. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told her to get her husband, but she denied having a husband. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told her that that was true, because she had been married five times and was not married to the man she was with now. Noticing His power, she indirectly asked about where God should be worshiped. He replied that the Samaritans are misled, and that the time has now come that people will worship God wherever they are, because they will and must worship God in spirit and truth because God is spirit. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told her that He was the Messiah. The disciples returned, and were surprised that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was talking to a woman. She then went into town and told everyone there that she may have found the Messiah, so the townspeople came out to see Him. Meanwhile, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples urged Him to eat, but He explained to them that His food was to finish God's work. He then explained that now is the time for them to harvest souls for eternal life, even though they did not sow them. Many Samaritans came to believe <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the Savior due to the woman's testimony and the two days that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> stayed with them. Later, in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was welcomed. In Cana, a royal official asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to cure his dying son. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the official that his son would live, and that he should go. The official returned to find his son healed, and that the healing corresponded to when <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had pronounced it, so his whole household then believed in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. This was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' second miraculous sign.
Jhn.5	Later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> for a Feast. On the Sabbath at the pool near the Sheep Gate, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healed one particular invalid man from the great number of disabled people there. This man had been disabled for 38 years. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the man to pick up his mat and walk. The Jews were angry that the man was carrying his mat on a Sabbath. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> later saw the man at the Temple, and told him to stop sinning or else something worse might happen to him. That man spread the word about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> healing him. The Jews persecuted <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for healing on the Sabbath, but He told them that He, and God, His Father, always work. The Jews then tried harder to kill Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained to the Jews that He only does what God shows Him to do, that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> gives eternal life and has been appointed by the Father to judge all people in order to have all people honor <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, that whoever hears <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and believes the Father will have eternal life - including some people who are dead now, that the dead who have done good will live but the dead who have done evil will be condemned, that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist testified about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, that what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> has done testifies even stronger about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> being from the Father, that although the Jews search Scripture for eternal life they ignore that the Scripture testifies about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, that they seek praise from one another as opposed to seeking praise from God, and that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> will accuse them for not believing what he had written.
Jhn.6	Later, near the time of Passover, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> crossed the Sea of <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink>. There, a crowd gathered around Him because He healed the sick. As a test, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376G' clickHandler>Philip</jLink></jLink></jLink> where they could buy bread for the crowd. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376G' clickHandler>Philip</jLink></jLink></jLink> said they did not have enough money to do that. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0406' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0406' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0406' clickHandler>Andrew</jLink></jLink></jLink> showed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> a boy with five barley loaves and two fish. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> took the boy's food, gave thanks, and distributed it to the 5000 men there. Afterward, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had the disciples gather the leftovers, which yielded 12 basketfuls. The people were impressed by the miracle, thought <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to be the Messiah, and wanted to make Him king, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> withdrew from them. That evening, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples got into a boat to cross the lake for <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink>. About 3.5 miles (??? km) out on the water, they saw <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> walking towards them on the water and became frightened, but they let Him in the boat anyway. The next morning, the crowd following <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> crossed the sea to search for Him and found Him in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2584' clickHandler>Capernaum</jLink></jLink></jLink> in a synagogue. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that they were only following Him because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had fed them, but they should instead seek eternal life by believing in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, who was sent by God. They asked Him for a sign, like how their forefathers got manna from God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them the true bread comes from God and gives life, and explained that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was that bread of life, but they have not believed Him. He went on to say that those who God gives to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will come to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and be accepted, that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> does only God's will, and that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will resurrect those chosen ones who believed in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for eternal life on the Last Day. The Jews questioned <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' words, because they knew that He was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2501G' clickHandler>Joseph</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s son, and thereby apparently not from Heaven. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that they cannot come to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> unless God, the Father, draws them there, that those who listen to God go to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, that those who ate manna are now dead but only those who eat of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' flesh, the living bread, (metaphorically meaning to believe in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> as God's method of providing life) will have eternal life, that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will give His life for the world, and that those who eat of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' flesh and drink His blood will remain in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> just as <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> will remain in them. Some of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disciples found this information hard to accept. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> wondered how they would react if they saw Him ascend to Heaven, and explained again that only those who are enabled by God to do so can come to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Some disciples left. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked the Twelve Disciples if they would leave too, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that they would not leave God's Holy One. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that one of the Twelve is a devil.
Jhn.7	Thereafter, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> stayed away from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3063N' clickHandler>Judea</jLink></jLink></jLink> because the Jews were trying to kill Him there. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' disbelieving brothers told Him that He should go to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> at the Feast of Tabernacles to be seen working miracles, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that they can go to the Feast without Him because it is not His time, and that the world hates Him because He calls their deeds evil. After His brothers left for the Feast, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> went there secretly. The crowds were murmuring privately about whether or not <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was good. Halfway through the Feast, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> began teaching in the Temple courtyard. The Jews wondered how He could be so wise without having studied. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that His teaching came from God, that He worked to honor God (who had sent Him there), and that although <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> gave them the Law they do not obey it, and yet they are trying to kill <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The crowd was confused by what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> meant about killing Him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He had astonished them with a miracle He did, that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> permitted circumcision on the Sabbath, but they are angry at Him for healing on the Sabbath, and that they should judge rightly. The crowd recognized <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> as being both a wanted man and possibly the Messiah, but they knew where He was from, so He could not be the Messiah. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> reiterated that He was sent by God, and said that they do not know God. Some of the crowd tried to seize <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, but He amazingly slipped away. Others thought that He might be the Messiah based on His miracles. The Pharisees and Chief Priests sent men to arrest <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He would be there for a short while and then would not be found. The Jews were confused by this. On the last day of the Feast, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said metaphorically that those who believe in Him would receive the Holy Spirit flowing through them. Some Jews thought He was the Messiah, but others doubted that because He came from <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H1551' clickHandler>Galilee</jLink></jLink></jLink> and was not from King <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s lineage or from Bethlehem. The Pharisees and Chief Priests were angry when the men who they had sent to arrest <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> came back empty handed because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had impressed them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3530' clickHandler>Nicodemus</jLink></jLink></jLink> suggested that they give <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> a fair hearing, but the Pharisees and Chief Priests balked at this idea.
Jhn.8	The next day <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> taught in the Temple courtyard again. The Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and asked Him for a judgement. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that one of them who had never sinned should throw the first stone at her. They all left, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the woman that she should go and repent from her sins. Later <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told the people that He was the light that people should follow so that they do not walk in darkness. The Pharisees questioned <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for being His own witness. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He knows that He is speaking the truth, and that His Father is also His witness. They asked where His father was, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that they do not know His Father. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He was going away, but they would die in their sins and could not follow Him because they where of this world and they did not believe that He was who He claimed to be. They did not understand. He said that when they see Him (the Son of Man) lifted up, then they will know that He was speaking the truth which came from His Father. Many believed Him. To those believing Jews, He said that they should obey His teaching to know the truth and be free. They were confused. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that sinners are slaves to sin, but the Son could set them free, and then said that they were trying to kill Him because they obey a different father.

The man's neighbors were amazed and confused, so the man explained how <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had healed him. They all went to the Pharisees, to whom the man again explained how <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had healed him.

The Jews tried to get a different answer from the man's parents, but they would not answer. They summoned the formerly blind man again for questioning, but he ultimately berated them for not recognizing that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> must be sent from God given the miraculous opening of his eyes, so they threw him out. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> found the man again and introduced Himself as the Son of Man. The man worshiped <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He had come to judge, and make the blind see and those who see blind. Some Pharisees asked Him about that, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that their guilt remains because they claim that they can see.

They did not understand Him, so <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He was the sheep's gate and would give a full life to the sheep, unlike the thieves who came before to steal and kill. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He was the Good Shepherd because He will lay down His life for the sheep, that His sheep know Him, including those who are not from that sheep pen who will also listen to Him, and that He has the authority to and will indeed lay down His life and take it up again as His Father has commanded. The Jews were divided on whether or not to believe <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

His sheep are protected from falling away, and He will give His sheep eternal life. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that He and God are one. At this, the Jews got ready to stone <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> for blasphemy, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> reminded them that the Scriptures had called men "gods" before, and said that even if they do not believe His words, they should believe because of the miracles that He had worked, which prove that He is in God and God is in Him. They tried to seize <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> but He escaped. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then went across the <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3383' clickHandler>Jordan</jLink></jLink></jLink>, where <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491G' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> the Baptist had baptized.

The Chief Priests decided to kill <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976H' clickHandler>Lazarus</jLink></jLink></jLink> as well because of his influence. The next day <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> headed into <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>, so the crowd met Him with palm branches and high praise. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> rode a donkey into <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> to fulfill a prophesy. Much of the crowd was there because of the resurrection of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2976H' clickHandler>Lazarus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. The Pharisees were exasperated by <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' popularity. Some Greeks asked to see <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> replied that He would soon be gloried and would produce much from His death, just like a dead kernel of wheat, that those who hate life will gain eternal life, that those who served Him would be honored by God, and that although He was troubled by His future He would not ask for God to save Him because that was why He was there. He asked God to glorify God's name, so God spoke and said that God had and would again glorify it. People thought they heard either an angel or thunder. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that now there would be Judgement and Satan would be driven out, and that He would attract people to Him when He was lifted up. The crowd challenged that the Messiah should instead remain forever, and asked who the Son of Man was. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told them that they should trust in the light (meaning Himself) while they have it, and then He hid Himself from them. The Jews did not believe in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> despite the miracles He had done. In fact, they could not believe, because God had blinded them just like what had been prophesied. Many others believed, but they did not confess their faith because they loved mankind more than God.. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that people who believed in Him believed in God as well, that He brought light into the world, that He does not judge people who reject Him, yet they will be condemned, and that He only spoke what God had told Him to speak; which were commands leading to eternal life.

Then <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> announced that one of them would betray Him, and thus would fulfill the Scripture, and that He was telling them this ahead of time so that they would believe Him. The Disciples were confused and asked who the traitor was. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> indicated that it was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2455H' clickHandler>Judas</jLink></jLink></jLink> by giving him some bread.

He explained that knowing and seeing <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was the same as knowing and seeing God the Father, which should be obvious based on the miracles that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had worked. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that when He returned to the Father, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> would help them perform even greater miracles whenever they asked for them in His name. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that those who obey His commands love Him, will receive the Holy Spirit (a.k.a. the Counselor), will see Him and be loved by Him, and will realize that He is in them just as they are in Him. A Disciple asked why <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> would not show Himself to the world. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> explained that only those who love Him would obey Him, and that the Holy Spirit would teach them even more and remind them of His words. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> gave them His peace and said for them not to be troubled or afraid, and explained that they should be glad that He was going away soon, that He was telling them this in advance so that they would believe, and that He did only what the Father commanded Him to do.

Jhn.20	In the early morning of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene found the tomb empty, so she then told Simon <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> and "the other Disciple" about it.

He gave them a blessing of peace, sent them out like God had sent Him, gave them the Holy Spirit, and told them that they now had the power to forgive sins. The Disciple <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2381' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2381' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2381' clickHandler>Thomas</jLink></jLink></jLink> was not with the others at that time, so he doubted that the others had really seen <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> again. A week later, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> again appeared in the locked room, but this time <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2381' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2381' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2381' clickHandler>Thomas</jLink></jLink></jLink> was there, so he then believed too. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> said that those who believe without seeing are blessed. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' miracles written in this Gospel are but a sampling of the many He performed, and are provided so that you can believe.
Jhn.21	Sometime later, six of the Disciples went fishing in the Sea of Tiberias. They caught nothing all night long. A man on shore questioned how many fish they had caught, and then suggested fishing out of the right side of the boat. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> they tried, and they caught so many fish that they could not even haul in the net. They soon recognized that the man on the shore was <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, so they headed for Him, towing the fish behind them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> invited them to have a breakfast of fish and bread with Him. This was the third time He appeared to the Disciples since the resurrection. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> asked Simon <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> three times if he loved Him, and also told him to take care of His sheep each time. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> told <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> that, when he was old, he would be led where he did not want to go, indicating how he would die. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> then led <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> somewhere. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> noticed "the Disciple whom <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> loved" following them, and so he asked <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> about him. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> answered <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink>, saying that it should not matter to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> if the other Disciple lives until <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> returns. This initiated the rumor that that Disciple would not die, but that is not what <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> had said. It was that Disciple who originally wrote down this testimony, and his testimony is true. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> did lots of other stuff too.
Act.1	After <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>’ ascension, the apostles gather in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> takes a leadership role and addresses the group, which includes John, James, and other disciples. He emphasizes the need to replace Judas Iscariot, who betrayed <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. They choose <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3159' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3159' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3159' clickHandler>Matthias</jLink></jLink></jLink> by casting lots, establishing him as the new apostle. This chapter sets the stage for the coming of the Holy Spirit and the growth of the Church.
Act.2	Describes the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles. They begin to speak in different languages, attracting a crowd of Jews from various nations. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> delivers a powerful sermon explaining that this event fulfills the prophecy of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3100T' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3100T' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H3100T' clickHandler>Joel</jLink></jLink></jLink> and proclaims <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> as the Messiah. Many listeners are moved and accept the message, resulting in about 3,000 people being baptized. This chapter highlights the birth of the Church and the importance of community among believers.
Act.3	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> heal a lame man at the Temple gate called Beautiful. The man, who had been lame from birth, is miraculously healed and begins to walk. This miracle draws a crowd, and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> seizes the opportunity to preach about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. He calls the people to repent and turn to God. The chapter emphasizes the power of faith and the role of the apostles in spreading the Gospel. The healing serves as a sign of God’s power and the reality of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' resurrection.
Act.4	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> and John are arrested for preaching about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> and healing a man. The religious leaders, including the High Priest <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2533G' clickHandler>Caiaphas</jLink></jLink></jLink>, question them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> boldly declares that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, whom they crucified, has risen from the dead. The leaders are amazed by the courage of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> and John but order them to stop preaching. Despite the threat, the apostles continue to spread the Gospel. The chapter ends with the believers praying for boldness, and the place where they meet is shaken, showing God's presence among them.
Act.5	Tells the story of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0367G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0367G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G0367G' clickHandler>Ananias</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4551' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4551' clickHandler>Sapphira</jLink></jLink></jLink>, a couple who lie about the money they received from selling their property. They keep part of the money for themselves while pretending to donate all of it to the apostles. As a result, both are struck dead for their deceit. The chapter highlights the seriousness of honesty within the Church. After this event, the apostles continue to perform many miracles, and their popularity grows. However, the religious leaders become jealous and arrest the apostles again. An angel of the Lord frees them from prison, and they return to preaching in the Temple.
Act.6	The Church faces a problem as the number of believers grows. Some Greek-speaking widows are being neglected in the daily food distribution. The apostles decide to appoint seven men to oversee this task, ensuring fair treatment. They choose <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler>Stephen</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376J' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5376J' clickHandler>Philip</jLink></jLink></jLink>, Procorus, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3527' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3527' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3527' clickHandler>Nicanor</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5096' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5096' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G5096' clickHandler>Timon</jLink></jLink></jLink>, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3937' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3937' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3937' clickHandler>Parmenas</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and Nicolas. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler>Stephen</jLink></jLink></jLink> is described as a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit. As he performs great wonders, he faces opposition from religious leaders, leading to false accusations against him.
Act.7	Features the speech of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler>Stephen</jLink></jLink></jLink> before the Jewish council.

Enraged by his words, the leaders drag him out of the city and stone him. As he dies, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4736' clickHandler>Stephen</jLink></jLink></jLink> prays for their forgiveness, echoing <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' words, demonstrating his faith and love even in death.

Many Samaritans believe and are baptized. Later, the apostles in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H3389' clickHandler>Jerusalem</jLink></jLink></jLink> send <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> and <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> to pray for the new believers to receive the Holy Spirit.

He arrests <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> and puts him in prison, intending to execute him after the Passover. While in prison, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> is guarded by soldiers, but the Church prays earnestly for him. During the night, an angel of the Lord appears, freeing <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> from his chains. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> escapes and goes to the house of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137L' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3137L' clickHandler>Mary</jLink></jLink></jLink>, the mother of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2491H' clickHandler>John</jLink></jLink></jLink> <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3138' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3138' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3138' clickHandler>Mark</jLink></jLink></jLink>, where believers are gathered.

Eventually, they believe <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G4074G' clickHandler>Peter</jLink></jLink></jLink> is truly free.

However, they face opposition, and they flee to <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3082' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3082' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G3082' clickHandler>Lystra</jLink></jLink></jLink>.

Soon after, some Jews from Antioch and <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2430' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2430' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G2430' clickHandler>Iconium</jLink></jLink></jLink> arrive and stir up the crowd against them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> is stoned and left for dead but miraculously survives.

While in prison, they sing hymns, and an earthquake opens the prison doors.

Rom.1	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink>, an apostle sent to spread the Gospel of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>; the scriptural prophesy of Him, His lineage connection to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H1732' clickHandler>David</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and His resurrection. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> was sent to call the Gentiles who belonged to <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> to an obedience to God through faith. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> writes this letter to all believers in <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G4514' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G4514' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='G4514' clickHandler>Rome</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> is thankful for their faith, and often talks about them and prays for them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> wants to visit them to preach the Gospel to them, to encourage them, and be encouraged by them. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> is not ashamed by the Gospel which brings salvation to all believers by creating a righteousness through faith. God's wrath is being revealed against those who have chosen to worship man-made idols instead of the real God, because God has made Himself known clearly through His creation. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> God has given the godless people over to sinful lusts, sexual immorality, and mental depravity. Because of this, they have no understanding, fidelity, love, or mercy. Despite knowing that God condemns sinful acts, they continue on in their sins and approve of those who do likewise.
Rom.2	Believers have no excuse to hypocritically judge anyone, for they will not escape being judged by God using the same standards which they have used to judge others. Believers should repent of their sins, because God will reward those who persistently do good, but will punish those who are egocentric, who reject truth, and who follow evil. Jew or Gentile, God will not discriminate or show favoritism. Those without the Law will die for their sins, and those under the Law will be judged by it. Those who obey the Law are righteous. Even some Gentiles by their nature do what is in the Law because it is written in their hearts. God will judge everyone's secrets through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. Jewish believers who are boastful in having the Law, are you fully keeping the Law? If you break the Law, you are essentially nullifying your circumcision. However, if an uncircumcised person obeys the Law, they will be regarded as being circumcised. A true Jew-in-spirit has a circumcised heart and receives praise from God.
Rom.3	Jews are advantaged because they have been entrusted with the words of God. Unfaithful Jews do not prove God to be unfaithful. Unrighteous human acts highlight God's righteousness, but we should not do evil to make God seem good. Jews are no better than Gentiles, because everybody sins and there is nobody who is righteous. The whole world is accountable to the Law. Nobody will be declared righteous by obeying God's Law, instead we become conscious of sin through the Law. God has now revealed the prophesied righteousness apart from the Law. All people have sinned, and those people who believe that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> was presented by God as an atonement sacrifice will be justified by grace. Nobody can boast, because this justification is based on faith, not by observing the Law. Jew and Gentile both can be justified through the same faith, and that upholds the prophesy.
Rom.4	Scripture says that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> was justified by faith, not by works. His belief was credited as righteousness. Works are rewarded by obligation, but the ungodly who simply believe are justified by God with the gift of righteousness. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> was justified by faith before he was circumcised, so he represents both the circumcised and the uncircumcised. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> and his offspring did not become heir to the world through the Law, but by their faith. If being an heir was dependent on the Law, then faith is worthless. The Law brings wrath, but there is no transgression where there is no law. The promise of grace is guaranteed to all of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s literal and figurative offspring through faith in God. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> had faith that God would fulfill His promise: to make <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0085' clickHandler>Abraham</jLink></jLink></jLink> a father, despite his being old and his wife being through menopause already. This faith was credited as righteousness by God. God will grant the same righteousness to those who believe in the sacrifice of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Rom.5	By faith we have peace with God, being in grace with God through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. We glory in suffering, which builds endurance, character, and hope. This is God's love, in our hearts through the Holy Spirit. Some may die for a good man, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> died for us while we were sinners. We have been reconciled with God through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' blood and resurrection. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler>Sin</jLink></jLink></jLink> and death entered the world through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler>Adam</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and everybody died because they all sinned. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler>Sin</jLink></jLink></jLink> existed before the Law, but nobody was accountable for it. Still, people died up to the time of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> without breaking God's commandments. Just like <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H0121G' clickHandler>Adam</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s sin condemned all people to die, God's gift of grace through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> has resulted in justification and eternal life being available to all people. God made the Law to make transgression increase, so that grace could increase even more.
Rom.6	However, we should not continue sinning to increase grace. We are dead to sin, as through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> we have died and now live a new life. Our old self was crucified with <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, so we are free from sin. Just as <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> now lives for God, so do we. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H5471' clickHandler>So</jLink></jLink></jLink> do not obey your natural, evil desires, but rather become completely an instrument of righteousness. <jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler><jLink data-type='L' data-strong='H5512B' clickHandler>Sin</jLink></jLink></jLink> is not your master, because you are under grace, not the Law. Do not continue to sin because of your status of grace, rather become a slave to righteousness, obeying God. Your prior wickedness gained you nothing but your present shame. Now your obedience will lead to holiness and eternal life. The wages of sin is death, but God's gift is eternal life through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Rom.7	The Law is only binding while someone lives. A widow is not guilty of adultery by marrying another man. You have died through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and now belong to Him. Before, our sinful lusts were aroused by the Law. Now through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' death, we are free from the Law to serve in the Spirit. If not for the Law, <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> would not have recognized sin. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> was alive before knowing the Law, but upon knowing it, sin in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> made him transgress the Law and thereby condemned him to death. However, the Law is not sinful itself, but rather it is holy, righteous, and good. The Law was used to bring about <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink>'s death and to make sin completely sinful. The Law is spiritual, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> is flesh and is sold to sin. Although <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> delights in God's Law and desires to obey it, he still sins because good does not dwell in him. Instead, sin living in him makes him continue to sin. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> is a prisoner to sin, and is thankful to be delivered from its consequences through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Rom.8	There is no condemnation if you are in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, because though <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> the law of the Spirit frees you from the Law of sin and death. The Law was powerless because of sin, but <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' sin offering condemned sin in flesh to make us (who live by the Spirit, not the flesh) fully righteous. Those in the realm of flesh cannot obey God's Law or please God, but those of the Spirit seek with their minds what God desires. You are not in the realm of flesh if God's Spirit is in you. If you do not have <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' Spirit, you do not belong to Him. Though your body will die due to sin, God will resurrect your mortal body because <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' Spirit is in you. We have an obligation to put fleshly sins to death by the Spirit in order to live. The children of God have received the Spirit, as we have received it. As God's children, we are heirs, and we may share is <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' suffering in order to share in His glory. Our sufferings now will be nothing compared to our future glory. All of creation has been yearning for the children of God to be revealed to be liberated from decay. We have patient hope for the time when our bodies will be redeemed. The Spirit intercedes for us in our prayers, aligning them with the will of God. God works everything for the good of His loving Elect. The Elect were predestined to be like <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, and accordingly called by God to be glorified. God is for us, and the resurrected <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> intercedes for us at God's right hand, so that nobody can condemn us. Though we may suffer all types of hardships, persecution, and disasters, we will never be separated from God's love through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Rom.9	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> wishes that he could be cursed in order to save all of the Jewish people, who ultimately contained the human lineage of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. God's word has not failed with the Jews.

Similarly, God's policy of Election can be seen in His favoring of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2384G' clickHandler>Jacob</jLink></jLink></jLink> instead of <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6215G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6215G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H6215G' clickHandler>Esau</jLink></jLink></jLink> from before their births. Is God unjust? No, God will give mercy and compassion on people according to His will. Human effort is irrelevant. God has the right to condemn or bless whoever He wants. What if God is being patient with His wrath on those who He has chosen to condemn in order to demonstrate His glory to His Elect? The Elect consist of both Jews and Gentiles, but only a small remnant of Jews will be saved from God's wrath. That is because the Gentiles obtained righteousness by faith, but the Jews have pursued righteousness through obedience to the Law. The Jews missed their goal of righteousness through works, stumbling on the stone which God placed in front of them.
Rom.10	<jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> desires that all of the Jews get saved, because they are zealous for God. Yet the Jews do not know God's righteousness, so they pursued their own. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> culminated the Law, making righteousness available to all believers. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='H4872' clickHandler>Moses</jLink></jLink></jLink> writes of righteousness, saying that people who obey the Law will live. However, righteousness by faith is available to all who believe in their hearts in <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>' resurrection and profess that <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink> is Lord. That is why it was so important to spread this Gospel; so that people could hear it and believe. Yet despite the Gospel reaching the ends of the world, most of the Jews have kept to their tradition of obstinate disbelief, just as it was prophesied.
Rom.11	God did not reject all of the Jews. Some of them He predestined to be included in the Elect, preserving a remnant by grace. God prevented the rest of the Jews from understanding His grace through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>. <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G3972G' clickHandler>Paul</jLink></jLink></jLink> hopes that the Salvation of the Gentiles will arouse at least some of the Jews by envy to the same Salvation. The Gentiles should not be arrogant in their present position, because, just like God did not spare the unfaithful Jews, God will not tolerate the Gentiles acting irreverently either. Jews who change into believers will be granted Salvation. The Jews are just being hardened until all of the necessary Gentiles have been saved. At that time, all of the Jews will then be saved because of God's promised love to their patriarchs. The Jews are just disobedient now to obtain the same mercy which has been given to the Gentile. God is smart beyond human comprehension.
Rom.12	Be a living sacrifice for God in body and mind in order to discern God's perfect will. Realize that we should all play different roles in the collective body of God's organization according to the individual gifts with which we have been graced. Be sincere in love, devoted in love and respect for each other, full of zeal for God, joyous in hope, patient of afflictions, and faithful prayers. Give to needy believers. Live in harmony with each other regardless of status. Do what is right. Bless your persecutors. Do not curse anyone or repay evil for evil, for you should let God handle vengeance. In fact, overcome evil by doing good to those who hate you.
Rom.13	Do whatever authorities tell you, because God has established all authority figures. Otherwise God will judge you. Authorities will not harm anyone for doing good, but they will readily punish wrongdoers. Pay the taxes, revenue, respect, and honor which is due to authorities. Pay all debts. Love your neighbor, and you will fulfill the Law. Understand that Salvation is coming very soon, so behave righteously through <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>.
Rom.14	Accept people into the faith even if they are not able to fully understand it, and do so without debating their understanding. Only God is their judge, and God is on their side. It does not matter what someone thinks is the right way to honor God, as long as they remain true to their belief. We all live and die for God, so do not be judgemental of a fellow believer. Each of us will stand before God's judgement for ourselves. Nothing is really unclean, but if someone regards something as unclean then it is unclean for them. Be aware of such regards from your fellow believers and alter your behavior as to not offend them and, by that offense, drive them away from belief. The Kingdom of God is about righteousness, peace, and joy, so do what is necessary to be harmonious with your fellow believers. This will please God and keep the peace. Keep your own particular views of right and wrong between you and God, and do not be a hypocrite.
Rom.15	We should overlook each others' faults and try to please one another. The Scriptures teach us endurance and encouragement, and may we all have that same attitude, like <jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler><jLink data-type='P' data-strong='G2424G' clickHandler>Jesus</jLink></jLink></jLink>, thereby bringing glory to God.
