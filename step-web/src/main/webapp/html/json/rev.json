"ESV_summary" : "\"The revelation of Jesus Christ\" (1:1) was probably written by the apostle John while in exile on the island of Patmos, off the coast of present-day Turkey. It was addressed to seven actual churches. Revelation begins with letters from Christ himself to these churches, letters that include commendation, criticism, and comfort. Then comes a long series of visions of judgment on the wicked, all in highly symbolic language. The church is depicted under great distress but is assured of the final triumph of Jesus as \"King of kings and Lord of lords\" (19:16), bringing to an end the rebellion of humanity and ushering in \"a new heaven and a new earth\" (21:1), where God himself will reign forever and ever (11:15). Revelation was probably written AD 95â€“96.",
"ESV_introduction" : "This last book of the Bible identifies itself as \"the revelation of Jesus Christ\", and its author is designated \"his servant John\" who was exiled to the Greek island of Patmos because of his faith. Traditionally, John is identified with the author of the Fourth Gospel. Addressed to seven historical churches in Asia Minor, the Book of Revelation was written to warn against spiritual indifference and to elicit courage under persecution. Because of the extensive use of symbolism and picturesque imagery, its interpretation has posed many problem for the student of the Bible. While recognizing the historical situation (Roman persecution) that elicited this writing, many interpreters look upon it as a prophecy depicting events that were to take place at the end of the age. The ultimate victory of Christ is the dominant theme of this book.",
