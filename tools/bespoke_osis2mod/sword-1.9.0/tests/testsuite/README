All tests are represented by a <test>.sh / <test>.good file pair.

To run a test:

./runtest.sh test

This will run test.sh > test.try and compare test.try to test.good and report any differences (failures)

To run all tests:

./runall.sh

===================================

To create a new test, do whatever you want in your new mytest.sh file,
call, executables, do anything you'd like and output results which
matter for a good test.

When all is running fine, output your .good file with:

./mytest.sh > mytest.good

That's it.  Simple right?  :)  So make more unit tests!
