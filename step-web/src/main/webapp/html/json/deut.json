"book_overview" : "Moses reminds them of their disobedient past and their promise to obey God",
"ESV_summary" : "Deuteronomy, which means \"second law,\" is a retelling by Moses of the teachings and events of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. It includes an extended review of the Ten Commandments (4:44–5:33) and Moses’ farewell address to a new generation of Israelites as they stand ready to take possession of the Promised Land. Moses reminds them of God’s faithfulness and love, but also of God’s wrath on the previous generation of Israelites because of their rebellion. Repeatedly he charges Israel to keep the Law. Deuteronomy is a solemn call to love and obey the one true God. There are blessings for faithfulness and curses for unfaithfulness. The book closes with the selection of Joshua as Israel’s new leader and the death of Moses.",
"ESV_introduction" : "The final book of the Pentateuch derives its English name from the Greek work deuteronomion, meaning the \"second law\", or the \"law repeated\". Deuteronomy is essentially Moses’ farewell address(es) to a new generation in which he summons them to hear the law of God, to be instructed in the application of its principles to the new circumstances awaiting them, and to renew intelligently the covenant God had made with their fathers - a covenant that must be faithfully observed as the condition of God’s blessings upon them in the Promised Land.",

"chapter_2_overview" : "We went into the wilderness. Thirty-eight years passed, then the LORD told us to cross by Moab. He delivered Sihon the Amorite to us.",
"chapter_2_summary" : "Moses tells of how God directed them from place to place. God did not make the Israelites lack anything while in the desert.

"chapter_4_summary" : "Moses tells the Israelites to obey the laws he is giving them, and do not add or subtract from them. Other nations will be impressed by these laws. Teach the laws from generation to generation. Do not make an idol, because God is jealous. Moses will die on the east of the Jordan. If the people become wicked, God will drive them out of the Promised Land. But if they look for God then, He will be merciful to them. God is the only God and He brought the Israelites to the Promised Land. The following are the laws that Moses told the people.",

Do not worship idols because God is jealous, punishing the family of those who hate Him down to their great grandchildren, showing love to those that love Him. Do not blaspheme. Observe the Sabbath. Honor your parents. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not give false testimony on your neighbor. Do not covet what your neighbor has.

"chapter_7_summary" : "Moses says: When you go into the Promised Land, you must destroy the inhabitants completely, showing no mercy. If you do not, they may convince you to start worshiping other gods, and God will destroy you quickly for that. Destroy all they hold sacred. You are the fewest people and God loves you. God loves those that love him and keep His commandments, but will quickly destroy those that hate Him. If you love God and keep His commandments, you will be blessed over all nations, including by not having closed wombs in people or livestock. Do not be afraid of the occupants of the Promised Land, even though they are greater in number. You saw how God plagued Egypt and pulled us out of slavery.

If you become proud and claim accomplishments as your own, God will kill you.",

If the slave doesn't want to leave, puncture his or her earlobe with an awl against your door and he or she will then be a servant to you for life.

The witnesses should be the first stone throwers. For a capital sin, a person should only be put to death if there is more than one witness to their sin. Difficult lawsuits are to be judged by the priests. Do everything they give as their judgement or be put to death. Your kings are to be chosen by God. The king should not have many wives. The king should not amass great personal wealth. The king should read the Law of God every day. The king is not to consider himself better than anyone else.",

Do not harbor anyone who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. God will provide a prophet like Moses and from the Israelites. If the people do not listen to the prophet, God himself will reckon with that person. A false prophet, or a prophet of other gods must be put to death. You will know a false prophet by if what a prophet proclaims in the name of the God does not take place or come true.",

If the people do what God tells them and God gives them all of the Promised Land, set up three more cities for refuge. A man who kills with malicious intent must be brought out a refuge city and killed. Do not move the boundary stones of inheritance. Two or more witnesses is enough to convict a man.

Anyone who has a new home, has a new vineyard, is engaged to be married, or is fearful of battle is excused from battle. First offer peace to a city in exchange for becoming slave labor. If the offer is not accepted, lay siege to the city. When the siege is over, kill all the men, leave the women, children, and livestock for your own use.

You may take a war-captured woman as your wife after she has mourned her parents for a month. If you are displeased with her, let her go free. If a man has two wives, one that he does not love, and one that he does love, the larger part of his inheritance must go to the firstborn son, regardless of which wife provided that son.

Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together. Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear. If a man marries a woman, dislikes here, slanders her by saying she was not a virgin, and her parents produce proof of her virginity with a [bloody] cloth, then the man should be fined 100 shekels of silver and will have to stay married to her. If no proof can be found, the woman is to be stoned to death. If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the wife should be killed. If, in a city, a man rapes a virgin promised for marriage to another man, both the man and the ex-virgin are to be stoned to death, the ex-virgin because she did not scream loud enough. If, in the country, a man rapes a virgin promised for marriage to another man, just the man is to be killed. If a man rapes a virgin that is not promised for marriage to another man, the man must pay the ex-virgin's father 50 shekels of silver and marry her and never divorce her.

No Ammonite or Moabite may enter the congregation. The Edomites and Egyptians may join the congregation after the third generation. When in a war camp, a man who has a nocturnal emission of semen is unclean until nightfall of the new day and must wait outside camp until then. When in a war camp, bury your waste products outside of camp. Protect a slave who takes refuge with you and let him go freely. Israelites should not become male or female prostitutes, for they are detestable to God. Do not take a prostitute's money for God. Only charge interest to foreigners for borrowed things.

A newlywed man is to stay at home pleasing his wife for one year. Do not take a man's livelihood as security for a debt. If an Israelite kidnaps an Israelite and sells him or treats him as a slave, the kidnapper must die. Treat skin diseases per the priest's recommendations. When you offer a loan to your neighbor, wait for him to bring you a pledge. If the neighbor is poor, return the pledge by sundown. Do not take advantage of the hired poor or needy. Pay a man each day. Fathers will not die for their children's sin, nor will the children die for their father's sin. Do not deprive the alien or orphan of justice.

However, if the brother refuses to do this, the widow, in front of the village elders, will take off one of the brother's sandals, spit in his face, and say that is what he deserves. If two men are fighting and a wife of one of them seizes her husband's assailant's testicles to try and rescue her husband, the wife's hand must be cut off. Use accurate weights and measures.

After crossing the Jordan, on Mount Gerizim the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin will bless the people; and on Mount Ebal the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali will pronounce curses. The Levites will say: Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol-a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of the craftsman's hands-and sets it up in secret. Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother. Cursed is the man who moves his neighbor's boundary stone. Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the road.
