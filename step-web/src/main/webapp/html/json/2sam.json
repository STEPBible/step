"ESV_summary" : "Second Samuel recounts David’s reign as king of Israel (about 1010–970 BC). As promised to Abraham, during David’s reign Israel’s borders were extended roughly from Egypt to the Euphrates. While David had many successes, after his sin against Bathsheba and Uriah (ch. 11) both his kingdom and his own family fell into chaos. His son Absalom led a bloody rebellion against him. Nevertheless David, author of many of the Psalms, was a man after God’s own heart (Acts 13:22), a model of deep, heartfelt prayer and repentance. The Davidic Covenant of chapter 7 establishes the eternal rule of David’s line, with its ultimate fulfillment in the coming of Jesus Christ. The author of 2 Samuel is unknown.",
"ESV_introduction" : "These books were named after Samuel, not only because he is the principal figure in the first part, but also because he anointed the two other principal characters, Saul and David. Originally a single book which was divided when translated into Greek, the books of Samuel cover a period of time in Israel’s history from the birth of Samuel to the close of the reign of David. First Samuel presents the transition from Israel’s judges to the monarchy. Second Samuel deals almost exclusively with the history of David and presents a vivid picture of the theocratic monarchy in which the king represents God’s rule over the people.",

David asks the man how he knows Saul is dead. The man says he found Saul still alive with Saul's own spear through himself, and said Saul asked the man to kill him, so the man did what Saul asked. The man said he brought David Saul's crown and arm band. David and his men tore their clothes and mourned for Saul, Jonathan, and the other Israelites that lost their lives. David asks where the man is from. The man said he was an Amalekite. David has the man killed because the man killed God's anointed man. David laments of Saul's and Jonathan's death in a song that curses the mountains of Gilboa to never have rain or dew, that says Saul gave the Israelites scarlet and finery, adorning them in gold, and how Jonathan's love was better than that of women.",

David blesses the men of Jabesh Gilead for burying Saul. Abner made Ish-Bosheth, a son of Saul, the king over all the rest of the Israelites. Ish-Bosheth was the king for two years. David was the king of Judah for 7.5 years. Abner and some men of Ish-Bosheth went to Gibeon. Joab and some men of David also went to Gibeon. Abner suggested to Joab that they should have some of their young men get up and fight in hand-to-hand combat. Joab agrees. Twelve men on each side lined up. Each man took out a dagger and jabbed it into their opponent's side, so they all died together. That place in Gibeon is now known as the Field of Daggers. The ensuing battle was fierce between the groups, but Davids men won. Joab, Asahel, and Abishai were all brothers. Abner was pursued by Asahel despite Abner warning him not to do so, so Abner killed Asahel. Joab and Abishai then pursued Abner. The men of Ish-Bosheth rallied behind Abner on a hill and made a stand. Abner called out to Joab regarding how long Joab would let his men pursue their fellow Israelites. Joab blew his horn and the battle stopped. Each group marched home. 20 of Joab's men had died, but 360 of Abner's men had died.",

Abner takes great offense to this, saying that he will help David become king of all of Israel or God can deal with himself very harshly. Abner sends a message to David saying he will help David become king over the Israelites. David says OK, but Abner must give David his wife Michal. David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth requesting Michal. Ish-Bosheth sends Michal to David, which makes her second husband Paltiel very upset. Abner instigates the elders of Israel and the Benjamites to want David for their king. Abner travels to David to tell him this. Abner tells David to allow Abner to assemble all of Israel for David so that they may make David king. Abner leaves. Joab returns from a raid and learns Abner was there. Joab is suspicious of Abner's intent, so he summons Abner back without informing David of this. Joab takes Abner aside and then kills him to avenge the death of his brother Asahel. David hears what Joab has done and curses his family to always have someone with a running sore, leprosy, a handicap, a death by sword, or a starvation. David orders Joab to tear his clothes, wear sacks, and walk in front of Abner's funeral procession. David and all of Israel weep for Abner. David sings a song for Abner, and then swears a fast until sunset. The people were pleased with David and found no blame in him for Abner's death.

During the procession, they celebrated with all their might. During the procession, the oxen pulling it stumbled, and Uzzah reached out to steady the Ark. God killed him for this irreverent act. David became afraid of the Ark and sent it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite where it stayed for three months. Obed-Edom was blessed during that time. Upon seeing Obed-Edom's blessings, he decided to bring the Ark to the City of David. David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf, and danced with all his might while the house of Israel shouted and blew trumpets. When Michal saw David dancing, she despised him. David had the Ark set under a tent where he then made a burnt offering and a fellowship offering, and then blessed the people in the name of God. After David distributed some food to them, the people went home. When David went home, Michal questioned how David could display himself dancing in front of everyone.

Joab does this, and Uriah is killed at Rabbah along with other Israelites.

She says yes, saying that David has knowledge like God. David tells Joab to bring Absalom back, but tells him not to let Absalom see David's face. Absalom was the most handsome man in Israel, and he had heavy hair. He had three sons and a beautiful daughter named Tamar. He did not see David's face for two years after he returned. Because he refused twice, Absalom burned Joab's fields to get Joab to bring a message to David requesting to see David. David summoned Absalom.

Absalom sent secret messengers out to proclaim him as king in Hebron. His conspiracy was gaining strength. David got word that the Israelites' hearts were with Absalom, so David flees fearing Absalom's wrath. David left with all his loyal men and his family, except 10 concubines he left to tend the palace. David asks a Gittite soldier why he is coming along, when he only arrived recently. The Gittite replies that he will go wherever the king goes. Zadok was there with the Levites and the Ark of the Covenant offering sacrifices. David tells Zadok to put the Ark back in the city, saying God will bring him back if He is pleased with him. David says for Zadok to stay in the city, and David will await information from him. David proceeds up the Mount of Olives barefoot with his head covered. He prays that Absalom's adviser Ahithophel will give out foolish advice.

Hushai says that Ahithophel is wrong, that Absalom should instead summon all fighting forces in Israel, and then use that force to kill all of David's men and David. Absalom and the Israelites liked Hushai's advice best because God was determined to frustrate Ahithophel's good advice. Hushai told Zadok to tell David about what happened and that David should flee. Ahithophel was angry that his advice was not followed, so he went to his home town and hanged himself. Absalom crossed the Jordan with the men of Israel.

David's men won the battle, though the \"forest claimed more lives that day than the sword\". Absalom gets his head stuck in an oak tree while riding his mule. A man saw this and told Joab. Joab asks while the man didn't kill Absalom. The man says because the king said not to harm Absalom. Joab takes three javelins and plunges them into Absalom's heart while he is still stuck in the tree. Then ten of Joab's armor bearers struck and killed Absalom. Joab sounded a trumpet to end the battle, and buried Absalom's body under a pile of rocks in a big pit.

Abishai says Shimei should be killed for cursing David. David calls Abishai an adversary and swears to Shimei he will not kill him. Mephibosheth also greets David. David asks why Mephibosheth didn't come with him. Mephibosheth replies that Ziba betrayed his request to go, and slandered him. David says he will divide the field between Ziba and Mephibosheth.

There were three mighty men in David's army, each of whom made miraculous battles. During one battle, David lamented not having water. The three mighty men risked their lives to get some water for David. David poured the water to the ground saying that it was not right to drink what men had risked their lives to get. There is list of famous valiant fighters and some of their deeds.",
"chapter_24_description" : "God incites David to take a census, then punishes Israel for it",
"chapter_24_overview" : "David numbered the people of Israel and then regretted it. The LORD sent a plague. David bought Araunah's field and made offerings.",
"chapter_24_summary" : "God was angry at Israel again, and incites David against the Israelites, making them collect a census. After nine months and twenty days of work, Joab reports to David that there were 800,000 men of Israel, and 500,000 men of Judah. David feels guilty for collecting the census and begs God's forgiveness. God tells David's seer, Gad, to tell David that he has three options for punishment; famine for three years, fleeing from enemies for three months, or three days of plague. David tells Gad to tell God it is up to God, whose mercy is great. God sends an angel to unleash plague on Israel. By the time the angel had reached Jerusalem, it had killed 70,000 people. God tells the angels to stop, saying this is enough. When David sees the angel, David asks God why He isn't punishing only David and his family since David was the one that asked for the census. God tells David through Gad to build an altar where the angel had stopped, a threshing floor owned by Araunah. Araunah offers the threshing floor and oxen to David for free, but David insists on paying for it. David builds an altar there and makes burnt offerings and prayers to God, so God answers the prayer and stops the plague.",
