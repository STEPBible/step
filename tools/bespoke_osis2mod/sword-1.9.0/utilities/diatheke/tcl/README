This script is intended for use with libraries and modules from
The SWORD Project, available at http://www.crosswire.org/

This script requires the Diatheke command line front end to The SWORD
Project. You should really install this first, including all optional
components: zlib, CLucene, ICU (preferrably icu-sword), and cURL. Then
install any modules you want to make available to users.

Modify the file biblebot-diatheke.tcl as necessary so that the two
variables "diatheke" and "dict" point to the copies of the diatheke
and dict programs on your system.

Finally, run the Perl script makebooklist.pl, which will
create/overwrite the file biblebot-diatheke-books.tcl. This includes
all books installed on the system, so remove any entries you want to
hide from users, as necessary.

To install Diatheke/Tcl, install an eggdrop IRC bot, copy the
Diatheke/Tcl .tcl files (biblebot-diatheke.tcl and 
biblebot-diatheke-books.tcl) to your eggdrop scripts directory, and
add a line to the end of your bot startup script to load the two
Diatheke/Tcl scripts, for example:
 
source /usr/share/eggdrop/scripts/biblebot-diatheke.tcl
source /usr/share/eggdrop/scripts/biblebot-diatheke-books.tcl

This script has been tested with eggdrop 1.3.23 & 1.6.19, but should
function fine in later versions.

When you get the script loaded, type !biblehelp in a channel where
the bot is present and it will give you a full list of commands.
More commands will appear to you depending upon which mode the bot is
in and whether you are an op on the bot or voiced in the channel.
