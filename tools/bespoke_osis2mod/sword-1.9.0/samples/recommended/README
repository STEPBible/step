In this configuration, a system-wide file is created
/etc/sword.conf
which points to the installation of common sword modules located under:
/usr/share/sword/

To use, as root, copy the sword.conf file located in this directory to /etc

$ su
Password: ********
# cp sword.conf /etc

then create a sword repository under /usr/share

# mkdir /usr/share/sword

You may also want to copy the locales directory to your new sword repository

# cp -R ../../locales.d/ /usr/share/sword

then install modules in /usr/share/sword

# cd /usr/share/sword
# unzip ~/DownloadedSwordModule.zip
