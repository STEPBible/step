"ESV_summary" : "Second Kings continues the saga of disobedience begun in 1 Kings, opening about 850 BC with the conclusion of Elijah’s prophetic ministry in Israel and the beginning of the work of his successor, Elisha. Israel spiraled downward in faithlessness, ultimately being defeated and dispersed by the Assyrians in 722. Judah, the southern kingdom, had several kings who trusted God and attempted reforms. But after many years of God’s warnings through Isaiah and other prophets, Judah’s sins were punished by Babylonian conquest starting in 605 and ultimately in the fall of Jerusalem in 586. The people were exiled to Babylon for seventy years, as prophesied by Jeremiah (Jer. 29:10). God remained faithful to his covenant despite his people’s faithlessness. The author of 2 Kings is unknown.",
"ESV_introduction" : "These books are the sequel to I and II Samuel and should be read as a continuation of the history of the Hebrew nation contained in the former work. Originally one book, I and II kings relate the history of Israel form the last days of David to the destruction of the northern kingdom, Israel, in 721 B.C., and to the fall of the southern kingdom, Judah, in 586 B.C. This is the period of Israel’s glory, division, decline, and fall.",

"chapter_1_summary" : "Moab rebelled against Israel after Ahab's death. King of Israel, Ahaziah, fell down and was injured. He sent messengers to consult with the prophets of Baal-Zebub to see if he would recover. God told Elijah to tell the messengers that Ahaziah will die because he wanted to consult with Baal-Zebub, so he did tell them. The messengers tell Ahaziah this and give a description of the one that said this, which Ahaziah recognizes as Elijah. Ahaziah sends a captain and 50 men to go get Elijah. When they find him on a hill and request he go with them, Elijah asks God to consume these men with fire, which God does. Ahaziah sends another captain and 50 men to go get Elijah. When they find him on a hill and request he go with them, Elijah asks God to consume these men with fire, which God does. Ahaziah sends yet another captain and 50 men to go get Elijah. When they find him on a hill, the captain pleads for Elijah to spare their lives and go with them. Elijah gets a message from God to go with them. When Elijah meets with Ahaziah, he tells him that Ahaziah will die because he wanted to consult with Baal-Zebub. Ahaziah dies without an heir, so Joram succeeds him as king.",

"chapter_2_summary" : "On his way to being called up into heaven, God leads Elijah to Bethel, Jericho, and finally to the Jordan River. Elisha insisted on going with him despite being told to stay behind 3 times. At the Jordan, Elijah rolls up his cloak and strikes the water with it, causing it to part so that Elijah and Elisha could walk across on dry ground. Elijah asks Elisha if there is anything he can do for him before going up to heaven. Elisha asks for a double portion of Elijah's spirit. Elijah says that will be difficult, but if Elisha sees him after he has gone to heaven, then it will be so. A chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha grabbed Elijah's cloak that had fallen, rolled it up, and struck the Jordan, which parted allowing Elisha to walk across on bare ground again. The men around said that the spirit of Elijah was resting on Elisha, and offered to look all around for Elijah. Elisha tried to convince them not to search, but they did so anyway without success. Elisha went back to Jericho, where the people complained that the water has gone bad. Elisha requests some salt in a new bowl, and he took the salt and threw it into the well saying that God has now healed this water and it will never again cause death or poor crops. Near Bethel on his way back to Samaria, some young men mocked Elisha's bald head. Elisha cursed them in the name of God. Two bears came out of the woods and killed 42 of them.",

He routes through the Desert of Edom and runs out of water after seven days. Joram summons Elisha at the request of Jehoshaphat. Elisha tells Joram to ask the prophets of Joram's fathers, but Joram says that God has brought these three kings together. Elisha asks for a harpist to play, and then hears God tell him that the army shall dig ditches and God will fill them with water, and that the Moabites will be handed over to them, and they shall overthrow every major town and fortified city, cut down all good trees, stop every spring, an put stones in the good fields. In the morning, the Moabites saw the water on the ground and mistook it for blood and went out to plunder the army. The army attacked and slaughtered the Moabites and did what God had said to do, destroying all the Moabite towns except Kir Hareseth, where Mesha was. The army surrounded Kir Hareseth and attacked it. Mesha sacrificed his firstborn son on the city wall. After that, the \"fury against Israel was great\" and Israel's army withdrew to its own land.",

She did this and all the bottles she had collected were filled. Elisha told her to sell the bottles to pay the debt and use the excess money to live on. A barren Shunammite woman makes a point to invite Elisha into her house whenever he passes through town and makes a room for him to stay. Elisha repays her by having God bless her with a son. One day while working out in the field, the son fell ill and died that same day. The Shunammite widow sought out Elisha and let him know the boy died. Elisha sent his staff with his servant Gehazi to raise the boy from the dead, but it didn't work. Elisha then goes to the boy and lays on him a couple times and the boy comes back to life and sneezes 7 times. There was a famine in Gilgal and Elisha went there. He had Gehazi prepare a stew for the men, but he accidentally used some poisonous gourds from an unknown vine in the stew. Elisha asked for some flour, and he put it in the pot and neutralized the poison. A man came with 20 loaves of barley bread and Elisha said to give it to the men. The bread man said that the 20 loaves of bread will not feed the 100 men, but Elisha says they will and there will be bread left over. There was bread left over.",

When he gets to Elisha, Elisha tells him to wash 7 times in the Jordan River to cure himself. Naaman got mad that Elisha didn't just ask for God to heal him there and then, but Naaman's servants convince him to do as the prophet says. Naaman is cured, and says now he know that God is the only god in the world, and begs to pay him. Elisha refuses payment. Naaman claims he will never worship another god again, asks for whatever amount of dirt that can be carried by 2 donkeys, and begs for forgiveness that he will bow in the temple of Rimmon while helping his master there. Elisha tells him to go in peace. Gehazi thinks that Elisha should have taken something from Naaman as payment, and journeys after him to get some payment, which Naaman freely gives. When Gehazi comes back, he lies and tells Elisha that he hasn't been anywhere. Elisha curses him and his descendants with Naaman's leprosy. Immediately Gehiza had leprosy.",

During construction, a man dropped a borrowed ax into the river. Elisha threw a stick in the water where the ax had fallen in, making the ax float up to the surface. The king of Aram arranged ambushes for the king of Israel, but Elisha always warned the king. The king of Aram, Ben-Hadad, asked who was the spy, and he was told that Elisha was informing the king of Israel. So Ben-Hadad sent men to capture Elisha. When the Aramean forces surrounded Dothan, the town where Elisha was, one of Elisha's servants became frightened. Elisha prayed to God and made the servant see the invisible forces protecting him; hills full of horses and chariots of fire. Elisha prays that the Aramean forces be blinded, and they are. Elisha leads the forces to the king of Israel and then prays that they are given their sight back, and they do get it back. Elisha tells the king not to kill them but to feed them. So the king prepared a feast for them, and afterward released them. So the Arameans stopped invading Israel for a while. Later, Ben-Hadad mobilized his entire army and laid siege to Samaria. Food was so scarce that a couple women had gone into cannibalism. When the king of Israel heard of this, he got angry with Elisha because he thought this disaster came from God, and swore to decapitate Elisha that day.

God had caused them hear the sound of a great army approaching so that they had fled for their lives, leaving everything behind. After doing some pillaging of their own, the lepers decided to report this finding to the king. The king cautiously confirmed this report, and then releases the Israelites to plunder the encampment.

The king of Aram, Ben-Hadad was ill and sent Hazael to Elisha to know if he would recover. Elisha told him to tell Ben-Hadad that he would recover, but wept and told Hazael that Ben-Hadad would die and Hazael succeed him and inflict great harm on the Israelites.

Jehu then kills all the relatives, chief men, priests, and close friends of Ahab in Jezreel and Samaria. Jehu tricks all of the priests of Baal of Israel into the temple of Baal and then he slaughtered them, burned the sacred stone, and converted the temple into a latrine. Although he destroyed Baal worship, Jehu permitted the worship of golden calves in Bethel and Dan. God says that because Jehu did what He requested, his lineage will be kings of Israel to the fourth generation. God reduced the size of Israel through conquests of Hazael.

This happened because God had enough of the evil that the Israelites were doing which mimicked the evil done by the nations He had driven out, despite the commandments not to do so and all the warnings through the prophets. Even the tribe of Judah was rejected from the Promised Land. When the homeland was resettled, God sent lions to kill many people because they did not worship Him.

Josiah's son Jehoahaz succeeds him as king at the age 23 and he reigns for 3 months. He did evil in the eyes of God. Pharaoh Neco captured Jehoahaz and made Josaih's son Eliakim king of Judah in his place. He renamed Eliakim to Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim became king at the age of 25 and he reigned for 11 years, doing evil in the eyes of God and paying Pharaoh Neco gold and silver in tribute.",

"chapter_24_overview" : "The LORD sent raiders against Judah. Jehoiachin ruled and Nebuchadnezzer took all Jerusalem captive. Zedekiah ruled and did evil.",
"chapter_24_summary" : "Judah became a vassal state of the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, for 3 years under Jehoiakim's reign before he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. God sent raiders from Babylon, Aram, Moab, and Ammon to destroy Judah. This happened because God was angered by the evil done by Manasseh because He was not willing to forgive. When Jehoiakim died, his son Johoiachin succeeded him as king at the age of 18. He did evil in the eyes of God. He reigned for 3 months until surrendering Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar deported everyone but the poorest people to Babylon, around 10000 men including 7000 military men. Nebuchadnezzar appointed Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, as king and renamed him Zedekiah. Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years. Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.",

"chapter_25_summary" : "In the 9th year of Zedekiah's reign, Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem up until the last year of Zedekiah's reign. Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, killed Zedekiah's sons before him, gouged out Zedekiah's eyes and brought him back to Babylon. Jerusalem was pillaged, its temples of God destroyed, and all but the poorest people were deported. A Judah man named Gedaliah was named governor of Judah. Ishmael, who was of Davidic blood, assassinated Gedaliah and then fled to Egypt. The captured Jehoiachin was given a prominent position in Babylon when Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon.",
