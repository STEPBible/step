"ESV_summary" : "As its name implies, Genesis is about beginnings. Genesis tells us that God created everything that exists. It shows that God is both the Creator and the Ruler of all creation. But it also tells of humanity’s tragic fall into sin and death, and of God’s unfolding plan of redemption through his covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Genesis includes some of the most memorable stories in the Bible, beginning with Adam and Eve (chs. 1–4), continuing through Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and ending with the life of Joseph (chs. 37–50), who died before 1600 BC Traditionally, Jews and Christians have recognized Moses as the author, writing after the Exodus from Egypt, commonly dated around 1440 BC though some prefer a date around 1260 BC",
"ESV_introduction" : "The word \"genesis\" signifies \"generation\" or \"origin\" and comes from the Greek translation of Genesis 2:4. It is an appropriate title for the first book of the Bible, which contains the record of the origin of the universe, the human race, family life, nations, sin redemption, etc. The first 11 chapters, which deal with primeval or pre-Patriarchal times, present the antecedents of Hebrew history from Adam to Abraham. The remaining chapters (12 - 50) are concerned with God’s dealings with the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Jacob’s son Joseph, all \"fathers\" of the people whom God has chosen to carry out His plan for the redemption of mankind. The book closes with these \"Chosen People\" in Egypt.",

On the third day, God moves all the water on the earth to one place called seas, and the rest of the earth, now dry, was called land; and He made every type of plant, and the plants that grow on that land that bear seed, and plants that had seeds in fruit; and those seeds would make the same types of plants from which they came. On the fourth day, God made the sun and the moon and the stars to mark seasons, days, and years. On the fifth day, God made every type of bird and every type of creature in the ocean. On the sixth day, God made every type of creature that moves on the land; and God created man in His image; and God created woman; and God told man to fill the earth with his offspring and rule it; and God told man that man governs over everything on earth; and God said seed-bearing plants and fruit bearing trees will be man's food, while everything else (except the creatures in the sea) will eat green plants for food.

In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God said to man that he could eat the fruit of any tree in the garden except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for he will die if he does eat of that tree. God parades the birds, the livestock, and the beasts of the field in front of man for him to name. The man, now called Adam, is put to sleep by God.

Since Rebekah favored Jacob, she told him to get two of his best young goats and she would cook them up, and then Jacob could present them and get the blessing intended for Edom/Esau.

God finally opens Rachel's womb, and she birthed Joseph. Jacob wanted to leave, but Laban wanted him to stay and told Jacob to name his price. Jacob agreed to continue working for him, taking the spotted and streaked goats and the dark colored lambs as payment.

Jacob sent all his possessions ahead of himself, and fled without telling Laban. Rachel stole Laban's house gods. Three days later, Laban found out and pursued Jacob. Seven days later, Laban met Jacob. God came to Laban in a dream and told him not to say anything good or bad to Jacob. Laban asked Jacob why did he run away and why did he steal Laban's gods. Jacob said he ran for fear of forceful retribution. Jacob said that if anyone in Jacob's camp stole the gods, that person will be killed. Jacob said Laban should look around take anything that belongs to him. Laban searches almost everywhere for the gods. Rachel had hidden the gods in her saddle bags in the saddle she was sitting on, and lied to her father saying she couldn't get up because she was having her period. Laban didn't find anything that belonged to him directly, yet claimed the daughters, children, and flocks as his, but he said that he would let Jacob keep those. Then they gathered some rocks and promised each other that they each would not cross over that pile of rocks to harm the other.",

The messenger reported back that Edom/Esau was coming with 400 men to greet Jacob. Jacob feared this meant an attack, and divided his party into two groups. Jacob sent several herds of animals ahead as gifts to Edom/Esau in the hopes it would pacify Edom/Esau. That night, he sent everyone else across a river while he remained on the other side alone. An angel showed up and wrestled with Jacob until daybreak. He couldn't overpower Jacob, so he touched Jacob in the hip socket, causing Jacob pain. The angel told Jacob to let him go, to which Jacob replied that he would let go only if he would bless him. He asked Jacob what his name was, and told Jacob that he will now be called Israel, because he struggled with God and overcame. Israel asked for God's name, to which God asked why he asked.
