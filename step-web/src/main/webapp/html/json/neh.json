"book_overview" : "(= 2Esdras in Catholic Bibles) Nehemiah leads people back from Babylon to rebuild the city and enforce obedience to the law",
"ESV_summary" : "In 445 BC the Persian King Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah, an Israelite who was a trusted official, to help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. With Nehemiah went the third wave of returning Jewish exiles. There was intense opposition from the other peoples in the land and disunity within Jerusalem. Despite this opposition, Nehemiah rebuilt the walls. He overcame these threats by taking wise defensive measures, by personal example, and by his obvious courage. Nehemiah did what God had put into his heart (2:12; 7:5) and found that the joy of the Lord was his strength (8:10). When the people began once again to fall into sin, Nehemiah had Ezra read to them from the Law. Nehemiah served twice as governor. The author is unknown, although parts come from Nehemiahâ€™s own writings.",

Nehemiah said he was sad because Jerusalem was in ruins. The king asked what he wanted, to which Nehemiah replied that he wanted to go rebuild the city, and that he needed to granted safe passage as well as timber from the king's forest. The king agreed to this, sending an army and cavalry with him. The Horonite Sanballat and the Ammonite Tobiah were disturbed by this action.

The priest Shemaiah told Nehemiah to take refuge in the Temple because people were going to kill Nehemiah, but Nehemiah refuses. Shemaiah had been hired by Tobiah and Sanballat to scare Nehemiah. Nehemiah prays that God remembers the sins of Tobiah, Sanballat, Noadiah, and the prophets that had tried to intimidate him. The wall repairs were completed in 52 days.

Eliashib the priest had given Tobiah a storeroom in the Temple, so Nehemiah purged that storeroom, had it purified, and then stored Temple goods there. Nehemiah also learned that the Levites and singers had been neglected in tithes, so he reestablished the tithes.
