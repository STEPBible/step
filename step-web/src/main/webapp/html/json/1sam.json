"ESV_summary" : "First Samuel records the establishment of Israel’s monarchy, about 1050 BC Samuel led Israel for many years in the combined roles of prophet, priest, and judge. After the people demanded a king like those of the other nations (ch. 8), God directed Samuel to anoint Saul as Israel’s first king. When Saul turned from God, David was anointed by Samuel to succeed him. After David killed the giant Goliath, he was brought to Saul’s court, eventually becoming the leader of Saul’s armies. Saul’s subsequent violent jealousy forced David to flee. The book closes with Saul’s death in battle, and looks forward to David’s reign. First Samuel’s author is unknown, but Samuel himself may have written portions of the book (see 1 Chron. 29:29).",
"ESV_introduction" : "These books were named after Samuel, not only because he is the principal figure in the first part, but also because he anointed the two other principal characters, Saul and David. Originally a single book which was divided when translated into Greek, the books of Samuel cover a period of time in Israel’s history from the birth of Samuel to the close of the reign of David. First Samuel presents the transition from Israel’s judges to the monarchy. Second Samuel deals almost exclusively with the history of David and presents a vivid picture of the theocratic monarchy in which the king represents God’s rule over the people.",

"chapter_1_summary" : "An Ephraimite named Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. God had closed Hannah's womb, so she had no children. Peninnah mocked Hannah for being childless. Hannah made a deal with God that if He allowed her to have a son, then she would devote him to God, and never cut his hair. Eli the priest sees her mouth moving with no sound coming out while she was praying, so he accuses her of being drunk again. She says no, she's just praying. The following morning, Elkanah and Hannah have sex and she gets pregnant. She gives birth to Samuel. After Samuel is weaned, she gives him to Eli's care for dedication to God.",

Eli's sons were wicked, treating the offerings with contempt, which was a great sin to God. Eli prayed that Hannah would have more children, and she gave birth to 3 sons and 2 daughters. Eli heard about what his sons were doing, and that they were sleeping with the women that served the tent of meeting. Eli tried to reason with his sons so they would stop their sins, but they wouldn't listen because it was God's will to put them to death. Samuel grew in favor with God and men. Some anonymous man of God gives Eli a message from God saying that because of his sons' behaviors, He will not honor His promise to let the men of Eli's lineage be priests. Furthermore, as extra punishment, all of Eli's descendants will die in the prime of their lives. When Eli's sons both die on the same day, that will be a sign. God will raise up a faithful priest to carry out God's desires. Eli's family will beg for a priestly office from God's chosen priest.",

The Philistines defeat Israel again slaughtering 30000 foot soldiers, captured the Ark, and killed Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas. A Benjamite fled from battle and told Eli what happened.

The Israelites of Beth Shemesh receive the Ark and make an offering of the cows, the gold, and the cart. There is a big rock in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh that is proof the Ark was there. 50070 (or maybe only 70) Israelites die from looking in the Ark. The people mourned this death.

Samuel is angered by this and prays about it. God tells Samuel it is God the people are rejecting, not Samuel. God tells Samuel to tell the Israelites the bad things a king will do to them. For the most part, the list sounds pretty close to what they are already doing for the Levites, other than the continuous army and the line that says they will become his slaves. Samuel says God will ignore them when they want relief from the king's oppression. The Israelites still insisted on having a king. God tells Samuel to let them have a king.",

Samuel says for Saul to then go to Gibeah where he will meet a group of prophets, and God will come upon Saul and change him. At that point Saul is to do whatever he wants, because God is with him. But Saul is to wait 7 days for Samuel to arrive and tell him what to do. When Saul left, God changed Saul's heart, and what Samuel told him came true. People said \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\". Saul's uncle asked him what happened, and Saul told him but left out the part where Samuel told Saul that he would be king. Samuel summoned the Israelites, and sorted through there clans until he called on Saul. Saul could not be found. So they asked God where he was. God said Saul was hiding with the luggage. Saul was a head taller than anyone else. Samuel said God selected Saul as their king. Samuel explained to the Israelites about what it means to have a king and wrote down the regulations.

Jonathan's men attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, then Saul sent a warning to the Israelites that the Philistines would be angry. Saul summoned the people to gather with him in Gilgal. The Philistines gathered a large force to fight the Israelites, large enough to bring fear to the Israelites. Saul had waited 7 days for Samuel to show up for the offering, and then made the burnt offering to God without Samuel. As he was finishing, Samuel showed up. Saul explains he was disparate. Samuel tells him his kingdom will not last because he broke God's command and God has chosen someone else to lead Israel, someone with a heart more like God's. At that time, only about 600 Israelites were still with Saul. The Philistines sent out 3 raiding parties. The Israelites were without real weapons because the Philistines had forbidden them to have blacksmiths. So they had various farm and craft implements sharpened by the Philistines for various costs.",

Jonathan says if they call the armor bearer and him up, it means that God has delivered the Philistines into their hands. The Philistines do call them up. They kill about 20 men in about half an acre of space. God send a panic to the Philistine army. This rouses Saul, who gathers his men and notes Jonathan and his armor bearer are missing. Saul calls for Ahijah (son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh) to bring the Ark to him. Saul attacked the Philistines, finding them in such confusion that they were fighting amongst themselves. The Israelites that had fled now rejoined the army. They pushed the Philistines back beyond Beth Aven. Saul had cursed anyone that would eat before his enemies were avenged that day, so none of the army had eaten. The pursuit led through a forest filled with honey, but no one ate it. Jonathan ate some honey because he was unaware of the curse. A solder told him about it, to which Jonathan calls Saul stupid for making such a curse. At the end of the day, the starved army started eating meat with blood still in it. Saul corrected this sin by establishing an altar to God where all the food was to be slaughtered. Saul wanted to attack the Philistines at night, but the priest advised asking God. Saul did ask, but God did not reply. Saul asks what sin has been committed this day that God will not answer. Saul says the perpetrator must die, even if it is his son. No one replies. Saul calls to God to help him find the sinner, if it lies with the army or with he and his son, with the flip of a coin (or by \"lot\"). He and his son get the indication. Saul calls for a lot again between him and his son, and Jonathan is indicated. Saul asks Jonathan what he did, and Jonathan says he ate honey. Saul says he will kill him, but the people sway his mind not to do so, pointing out that Jonathan, with God's help, was responsible for the routing of the Philistines. Saul stops pursuing the Philistines and returns to his own land. In his kingship, he fought the various enemies of Israel: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. He defeated the Amalekites as well. There is some talk of Saul's family structure. Saul recruited any good man he found.",

Saul musters 210,000 men and tells the Kenites to separate themselves from the Amalekites so they will not be destroyed as well, because the Kenites had helped Israel during the Exodus. Saul attacks and destroys all the Amalekites except their king Agag and the army kept the best plunder of livestock. God tells Samuel He is unhappy that He chose Saul as king because of this. Samuel tracks down Saul to question him about this. Saul says that he did destroy the Amalekites, captured their king, and kept the best livestock to sacrifice to God. Samuel tells Saul that obeying is better than offering a sacrifice, that rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance is like idolatry, and since Saul rejected God, God rejects Saul as king. Samuel says God does not lie or change His mind. Saul begs forgiveness and that Samuel should go back to worship God, but Samuel says that he will not as God has rejected him as king. Saul grabs at Samuel and tears his robe. Samuel says God has torn Israel from Saul to one that is better than him. Saul begs again to pray with Samuel, and Samuel agrees to do so. Samuel summons Agag and kills him before God. Samuel never saw Saul again, but he mourned for Saul and God grieved for making Saul king.",

God says to take a cow with him and say it is for sacrifice, and go to see Jesse of Bethlehem. God tells Samuel to invite Jesse to the sacrifice. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders were afraid. But Samuel said he came to give a sacrifice to God. He then told the elders to consecrate themselves elders and join him for the sacrifice. Samuel consecrated Jesse and Jesse's sons and invited them all to the sacrifice. They gathered for the sacrifice, and 7 of Jesse's sons passed before Samuel without an indication from God. God told Samuel that He does not look at the outside appearances of men like men, but at their hearts. Samuel asked Jesse if he had any more sons, and Jesse told him that the was on tending sheep. They summoned this shepherd son, David, who was ruddy and handsome. God told Samuel to anoint David, and when he did, the spirit of God came upon David in power. The spirit of God left Saul, and God sent an evil spirit to torment Saul. Saul's servant suggests that a harpist may make him feel better. Another servant knows that David, who is a brave man and a warrior and good looking, is a harpist. Saul sent for David, and liked him well enough to make him his armor bearer and to request that David remain in his service. When David played the harp, Saul felt better.",

"chapter_17_summary" : "The Philistines assembled their army on on hill, and the Israelites under Saul's leadership assembled their army on an adjacent hill, with a valley between the encampments. A Philistine champion named Goliath, who stood nine feet tall and had bronze scale armor weighing about 125 pounds and a spear weighing about 15 pounds, challenged the Israelites to a duel. The winner of the duel would earn for their nation the subjugation of the other nation. The Israelites became frightened. The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to this war, but David went back and forth between home and Saul to tend the sheep as necessary. Goliath made the challenge each morning for 40 days. Jesse gave David some goods for his sons at war and sent David to deliver them and get news from the three sons. When David arrived, the Israelites were lining up for battle, when Goliath made his challenge again. This set all the Israelites running away. David asks what will be given to the person that kills Goliath, and the soldiers tell him that man will have one of Saul's daughters to marry, will be given great wealth, and his family will be exempt from taxes. David's oldest brother gets mad when he sees David there, and accuses him of neglecting the sheep just to watch the battle. David dismisses his brother's comments and asks others to confirm the reward for Goliath. David tells Saul he will fight Goliath. Saul says David can't because he is only a boy and Goliath has a lot of experience fighting. David says he has beaten a lion and a bear, and surely the God that spared him against these predators would deliver him from the uncircumcised Philistine that defies the army of the living God. Saul agrees and says for God to be with him. Saul tried to give David armor and a sword, but David rejected them since he was not familiar with them. Instead, he armed himself with his staff and five stones for his sling. Goliath approached and, seeing that David was a handsome young boy, despised him and taunted him about his choice of weaponry. David defiantly claims that it is through God's power that he will prevail against Goliath. Goliath approached for battle and David ran towards him, took out a rock, and slung it into his forehead, killing him. David took Goliath's sword and cut off Goliath's head. The Philistines turned and fled. The Israelites gave chase, killing many along the way. Then the Israelites returned to plunder the Philistine camp. David claims Goliath's head and his weaponry.

Jonathan made a covenant with David, taking off everything he was wearing and giving it to David. David had great success in any assigned task, so Saul promoted him highly. When returning from the battle with the Philistines, the people praised David more highly than Saul, so Saul became jealous. An evil spirit from God cause Saul to attack David with his spear, which David avoided. David's popularity increased with time and accomplishments. Saul hopes the ongoing war with the Philistines will claim David's life. Saul offers his oldest daughter Merab for David to marry, but David humbly refuses. Merab marries someone else. Saul offers his younger daughter, Michal, to David for marriage. David says he is poor and not well known. Saul replies that the bride price is one hundred Philistine foreskins. David was happy, and went out and killed two hundred Philistines, bringing their foreskins back for the bride price. David married Michal. Saul became more afraid of David.

Once again, an evil spirit from God cause Saul to attack David with his spear, which David avoided and escaped. Saul sends soldiers to David's house to kill David. David's wife Michal tells him to flee for his life, which he does. Michal stuffed David's bed with an idol dressed to look like a man. When the soldiers question her about David, she says he is ill in bed. The soldiers found the bed stuffed. Saul asks Michal why she lied and let Saul's enemy go. She replies that David was going to kill her otherwise. David flees to Naioth. Saul hears about this. Saul sends men there to capture David, but each of three separate successive group s of men runs into Samuel with a group of prophets and end up being overtaken by the spirit of God prophesying with the prophets instead of capturing David. Saul decides to go to Naioth himself, be he also is overtaken by the spirit of God and starts prophesying, even stripping down naked for a day and night.

David will prove Saul wants to kill him to Jonathan based on Saul's reaction to skipping dinner with Saul on the New Moon festival. Jonathan is in disbelief of Saul's intentions, but Jonathan takes an oath to follow out David's dinner plan and will let David know Saul's reaction. Jonathan repeated his covenant with David out of love for David. Jonathan devises a plan to communicate Saul's intention indirectly. The first night of the festival, Saul says nothing of David's absence, thinking that David must be unclean. The second night, Saul inquires of Jonathan where David is, to which Jonathan says David went home for a sacrifice. Saul gets angry, calls Jonathan the \"son of a perverse and rebellious woman\", and sends men out to bring David to him to kill David. Jonathan asks Saul why he would do this, to which Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to try and kill Jonathan. Jonathan does his indirect message to David. Then he goes and talks to David.

Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head shepherd, was there that day. David then demanded a weapon. Ahimelech said only Goliath's sword is there. So David took it. David fled to Achish king of Gath.

David sends ten men to a wealthy man who was a Calebite and was surly and mean in his dealings named Nabal (who had a beautiful and intellegent wife named Abigail) to request whatever Nabal could spare, stating that nothing was missing while his shepherds were around David's men and his men treated the shepherds kindly. Nabal refuses to give anything. David takes 400 armed men to go see Nabal, leaving 200 back with the supplies. A servant tells Abigail that Nabal refused to give anything to David's men, even though they had not harmed Nabal's shepherds. Abigail arranges for goods to be sent to David and she heads out to greet David herself. Just before David met Abigail, David, being upset with his lack of reward for watching Nabal's property, swore that he would not leave a male descendant of Nabal's alive by the next daybreak or God could deal with David severely. Abigail presents the goods she has brought David, pleads for forgiveness, and pleads that David let God avenge for him. David grants her request. Abigail told her husband about what happened and what she did. Ten days later, God killed Nabal. When David hears of Nabal's death, he praises God and asks Abigail to marry him. Abigail accepts. David also marries Ahinoam of Jezreel. Saul gave Michal, David's first wife, to Paltiel to marry.",

David calls out to Abner, the commander of Saul's army, taunting Abner that he permitted Saul's spear and water jug to be taken. David asks Saul why he is pursuing him, saying if God has incited Saul against David, let God accept an offering. Saul repents his own actions against David.

Samuel tells Saul that since Saul did not carry out God's fierce wrath, God has turned against him today. Samuel tells Saul Israel will lose this battle and Saul and his sons will die tomorrow.
