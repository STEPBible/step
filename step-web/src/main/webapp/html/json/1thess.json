"ESV_summary" : "Paul wrote this letter to encourage new believers in their faith, to exhort them to godly living, to give them assurance about the eternal state of believers who had died, and to defend the integrity of his ministry as an apostle. Thessalonica (present-day Thessaloniki, Greece) was the capital of Roman Macedonia. It was on important trade routes. Paul, twice identified as the author (1:1; 2:18), visited Thessalonica on his second missionary journey but was forced to flee because of Jewish opposition. He sent Timothy to work with the largely Gentile church there, and Timothy brought him good news of their faith (3:6). This is one of Paul’s first letters, probably written about AD 50–51.",
"ESV_introduction" : "These letters constitute what is probably the earliest writing of the Apostle Paul. There were written in A.D. 51-52, soon after the founding of the Thessalonian church, and give Paul’s answer, to some basic problems disturbing the Christians of Thessalonica. The major contributions are eschatological, investigating especially the events preceding and accompanying the return of Christ. The concern of Paul for his followers is apparent throughout.",

The Thessalonians became an example to all believers in Macedonia and Achaia. Paul highlights their turn from idols to serve the living God and to wait for Jesus, who delivers them from the coming wrath.",

He emphasizes that he did not come with deceit or flattery but preached the Gospel boldly, despite suffering.

"chapter_5_summary" : "Paul encourages the Thessalonians to stay alert and be prepared for the Day of the Lord, which will come unexpectedly. He contrasts the darkness of those who are unaware with the light of those who belong to the day, and instructs them to encourage one another and build each other up. He gives practical advice on how to live: rejoice always, pray continually, and give thanks in all circumstances. Paul concludes with blessings and instructions for the church.","chapter_outline_icc_url" : "https://archive.org/details/criticalcommenta00framuoft/page/n9/mode/2up",
