This folder contains Android bindings based on the java-jni bindings.

The first step to building these bindings is to build the java-jni/
bindings.  These bindings use code generated from there.
See the ../java-jni README before continuing.

There is an Android Studio project here under SWORD/

This Android Studio project should be used to build the NDK
native code here.

After that, a make in this folder will copy the native libs
to the ../cordova/ bindings to produce a working cordova plugin

The steps to build all of this are usually:
1) make in the ../java-jni bindings folder
2) build all in SWORD Android Studio project
3) a make in this folder, which finally copies the binary libs
	to the ../cordova/ bindings folder to produce a working
	cordova plugin

Android java bindings can be used after step 2
cordova javascript bindings can be used after step 3

Hope this helps get you started.  Let me know your progress!
