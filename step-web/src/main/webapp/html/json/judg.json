"ESV_summary" : "Judges is named after an interesting collection of individuals who led Israel after Joshuaâ€™s death until the rise of the monarchy under Samuel (up to about 1050 BC). In this time of national decline, despite their promise to keep the covenant (Josh. 24:16-18) the people turned from the Lord and began to worship other gods. \"Everyone did what was right in his own eyes\" (17:6; 21:25). A pattern repeats throughout the book: 1) the people abandoned the Lord; 2) God punished them by raising up a foreign power to oppress them; 3) the people cried out to God for deliverance; and 4) God raised up a deliverer, or judge, for them. The author of the book is unknown, although some Jewish tradition ascribes it to Samuel.",
"ESV_introduction" : "Named after the \"Judges of Israel,\" the heroic leaders whose deeds it records, this book covers a period of time from the death of Joshua to the birth of Samuel, an era often called \"the dark ages\" of Hebrew history. Here is a story, on the human side, of disobedience and disaster, and on the divine side, of direction and deliverance. Of the 13 judges named, only 3 are well known: Deborah, Gideon, and Samson.",

"chapter_1_summary" : "God tells the Israelites that Judah will now lead them to victory over the Canaanites in place of Joshua, and He has given the Canaanites into the Israelites hands. Judah enlisted the Simeonites to fight as well. Judah attacked the Canaanites and Perizzites, killing 10,000 at Bezek. They found Adoni-Bezek and cut off his thumbs and big toes. Adoni-Bezek considered this payback for 70 kings he'd given the same punishment. Adoni-Bezek died in Jerusalem. Judah attacked Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills, in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. Caleb gives his daughter Acsah to Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother, for taking Kiriath Sepher. Acsah requested and received the upper and lower springs from Caleb. Judah totally destroys Zephath (Hormah), and took Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron. Although God was with Judah, They could not drive out the people of the plains because those people had iron chariots. Hebron was given to Caleb. Joseph attacked Bethel (formerly Luz) and killed the entire city but the family of a man that helped the invasion. This family built a new city called Luz. Manasseh left some \"determined\" Canaanites living in the lands and eventually made them slaves. Ephraim left Canaanites as well. Zebulun left Canaanites as well, which were eventually turned into slaves. Asher left Canaanites as well. Naphtali left Canaanites as well, which were eventually turned into slaves. The Amorites held the Danites from entering the plains. Amorites in Mt. Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim were turned to slave by Judah.",

This occurred at Bokim. The generation after Joshua knew not God or what He did for Israel. They broke God's covenant and worshiped Baals and other pagan gods. God was angry and sent raiders to defeat them. Then God raised up judges (leaders) to save them from the raiders, because God had compassion on the Israelites for their suffering. The Israelites continued their disobedience to God despite the judges, and become more corrupt after each judge dies. God leaves the people of the Promised Land among the Israelites to test them.",

The Israelites find peace for 40 years. The Israelites became corrupt. God gives power over the Israelites to Eglon king of Moab for 18 years. After the Israelites cried out to God, He sends Ehud as a judge to liberated them. Ehud was left-handed. He tricks Eglon into private council and assassinates him with a short sword plunged completely into Eglon's fat body. Then Ehud escapes and leads the Israelites into battle killing 10,000 Moabites.

Sisera was Jabin's army commander, and he had 900 iron chariots. The Israelites were cruelly oppressed for 20 years when they finally called for help from God. Deborah was the judge/leader of Israel at that time. The Israelites came to Deborah for guidance. She sends a message to Barak from \"the God of Israel\" saying to gather 10,000 men to attack Sisera and his troops at the Kishon River where God will lure them. Barak says he will, but only if Deborah goes with Barak. Deborah agrees to go with him, but says that the honor for the battle will not belong to him because God will hand over Sisera to a woman. Sisera gathers his army. Deborah tells Barak to go attack and God has gone before him. At Barak's troop's advance, God routs Sisera's troops by the sword. The Israelites kill all of Sisera's troops. Sisera himself flees to Heber's (a direct relative of Moses) tent. Jael, Haber's wife, hid Sisera and gave him milk.

God sent them a prophet that said the Israelites worshiped pagan gods. The Angel of God appeared to Gideon and said that God is with him. The Angel of God tell Gideon to save the Israelites. Gideon questions how he can do that since he is the smallest guy in the weakest tribe, Manasseh. God says he can do it with His help. Gideon asks for a sign and tells God to wait for his offering. Gideon brings his offering and God consumes it with fire. God tells Gideon to destroy his father's altar to Baal, make a new altar to God there, and provide a bull offering. Gideon does this at night. The men of the town get angry in the morning and call for Gideon's death.

God helps whittle the troops down to just 300, those that lapped water like dogs, while 31,700 left to go back home. God tells Gideon to attack the Midianite camp, but if he is afraid, Gideon and his servant should go down and listen to the camp. Gideon and his servant go to the camp and overhear a dream prophesy that Gideon will take the camp. Encouraged now, Gideon rounds up his 300 troops into 3 groups and goes to attack the Midianites.

He swears to tear down their tower. 120,000 swordsmen of the Midianites had fallen. Gideon finds the 15,000 remaining in their army and routs them, and captures the two Midianite kings. Gideon punished the 77 Succoth officials with thorns, then tears down the tower at Peniel and kills the men of that town. The two Midianite kings admit to killing Gideon's brothers at Tabor, so Gideon orders his son to kill the kings. His son won't do it. The kings tell Gideon to do it himself and he does. For his leadership, the Israelites want Gideon to rule. Gideon says he will not rule the Israelites, God will do that. But he will take a reward of gold earrings. Talking the reward, he makes an ephod out of it. All Israelites worship the ephod. There was peace for 40 years. Gideon had 70 sons with his many wives and concubines.

Gaal son of Ebed moved to Shechem and starts to get support from the citizens to overtake Abimelech. Zebul the governor alerts Abimelech and Abimelech sets an ambush.

Jephthah repeats his words to God in Mizpah. Jephthah asks the Ammonite king why he is attacking. The king replied that the Israelites took their land. Jephthah replies with a summarized account of how Israel obtained the land, and adding God, the god of Israel, gave it to them. He challenges that wouldn't the king take what his god Chemosh gives him? Jephthah asks why the king did nothing for the 300 years until now that Israel owned the land. The king ignores Jephthah's reply.  Jephthah vowed that he would sacrifice as a burnt offering whatever greeted him from his house when he returned home if God would deliver the Ammonites to him. Jephthah subdues the Ammonites. His daughter, his only child, dances out to greet him at his house. Jephthah tells his daughter she must die because of his vow to God. His daughter agrees, but requests two months to wander and weep (because she didn't marry) with her friends. After two months, Jephthah fulfils his vow.

Delilah proceeds to nag him day after day for the real way to subdue him until he can take no more nagging and finally reveals the true secret of his strength (his hair) and how to subdue himself.

They waited in the town square for some time, but no one invited them to rest at their house. An old man finally invited them into his home for the night. Wicked men of the city began to surround the old man's house, demanding that he send the Levite out so they could have sex with him. Instead, the old man offers his virgin daughter and the Levite's concubine. They ignore the old man so he takes the Levite's concubine and sends her outside. The men raped and abused her through the night. When they were done with her, she went back to the old man's house and fell down at the door.

After the telling, all the people rose \"as one man\" and said they will bring the city of Gibeah to justice, by attacking it of course. The assembled Israelites demand the Benjamites to give up the evil people of Gibeah, but they prepare to guard Gibeah instead with 26,000 swordsmen and 700 highly accurate, left-handed stone slingers. The Israelites ask God who should attack first, to which God replies Judah. The first day of battle, 22,000 Israelites are slain. The Israelites ask God should they continue the battle, and God says yes. This results in 18,000 more Israelites being slain. All the remaining Israelites then went to Bethel, fasted, and made offerings. They asked God if they should attack again. God says yes, and this time He will deliver them into their hands. This time the Israelites actually used tactics to fight, setting up an ambush for Gibeah for when another line of soldiers lured the Benjamite warriors from their position. When the Benjamites had killed 30 Israelites, they claimed they were beating the Israelites as before. Gibeah was put to the sword and burned. The smoke signaled the counter-attack that would kill most of the Benjamite warriors. 600 Benjamites fled to the rock of Rimmon, while all the rest were killed.

But they had made a vow that none of the Israelites at the battle should give their daughters to a Benjamite for a wife, or they would be cursed. Well, they realized the people of Jabesh Gilead had not attended the battle, so they had to be killed. The Israelites decided and carried out a plan to kill everyone but the virgins from Jabesh Gilead, and marry the virgins to the Benjamites. But there were only 400 virgins, so 200 Benjamites remained without wives. They let the 200 spouse-less Benjamites ambush some dancing women during a festival to God in Shiloh.
