Building Perl or Python (through swig)
-------------

Using autotools
---------------
See swig/packages/README

Using CMake
-----------
Building the SWIG (Perl, Python) bindings with the CMake toolchain requires installing
the CMake application appropriate to your operating system (most Linux distributions
will have this as an existing package as CMake is integral to building many popular
applications).

Additionally you will need the development packages for the language you are targeting
and the swig application itself. All of these should be directly available through your
distribution's package system.

Python: In Fedora you can get this with a 'yum install python-devel' and a similar call
to apt-get in Debian/Ubuntu/etc.
Perl: In Fedora you're looking for 'yum install perl-devel' and the equivalent package
in Debian/Ubuntu/etc.

After this, you need to add the argument -DSWORD_BINDINGS="Python" or
-DSWORD_BINDINGS="Perl" when you invoke CMake. If you wish to build both bindings then
just call -DSWORD_BINDINGS="Python Perl" instead. This needs to be done at the level of
the whole SWORD library and not just here within the bindings directory. The files will
be installed to their standard system-wide location when you run 'make install' with
the rest of the library.

If you wish to install the Python bindings to another directory instead you can specify
the option -DSWORD_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR="/some/other/path" at configure time. No comparable
option is currently available for the Perl bindings because the maintainer is unaware
of how to implement it.
