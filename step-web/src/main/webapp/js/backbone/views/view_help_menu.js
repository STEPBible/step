				'<li>Open and compare a Bible alongside one or more other Bibles in any language, including Greek and Hebrew texts.' + 
				'<li>View the verses of each version interleaved, or view them side-by-side.' +

				'<p>STEPBible enables all Bible translations to become study Bibles, and allows all users to explore the Bible in their own language and access the best Bible expertise.  The software is multi-lingual, and free to use and to download as a tool that continues to work when the Internet fails.' +
 
				'<p>STEPBible automatically opens in the language of the computer user and includes Bibles in hundreds of languages. It aims to allow anyone to read the Bible in their mother tongue, give them the opportunity to quickly find the passages they are seeking, and then to read or study the text as deeply as they wish.' +
 
				'<p>In addition to being used extensively in the disadvantaged world, STEPBible is also used in Bible schools in the West who value its wide range of unique features. Some colleges have even made STEPBible compulsory for their students.' +

				'<p>STEPBible automatically lists all the Bibles in the language of the user\'s computer, so they can see which Bibles are available, and compare them, as they look for their ideal Bible. The interface is available in more than 50 gateway languages and hosts Bibles in hundreds of languages.' +
