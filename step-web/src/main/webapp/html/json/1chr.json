"ESV_summary" : "First and Second Chronicles, originally one book, was written sometime after Judah began to return from the Babylonian exile in 538 BC (1 Chron. 9:1-2; 2 Chron. 36:23). It focuses primarily on the history of Judah, the southern kingdom of divided Israel. First Chronicles begins with several genealogies, with special emphasis on David and Solomon. The \"chronicler\" moves next to the history of the kingdom under David, stressing David’s deep interest in worship and his detailed plans for the construction of the temple—which would be built by his son Solomon. First Chronicles was probably written to reassure the returned exiles of God’s faithfulness toward his people. Its author is unknown, although many have thought that Ezra was the principal writer.",
"ESV_introduction" : "In the Hebrew Canon these books formed a single volume called \"Things of the days\" (i.e., annals). The translators of the Greek Septuagint Version gave them the title, Paraleipomena, meaning \"things left over\", implying their use as a supplement to Samuel and Kings. Jerome (c. A.D. 340-420) called them \"a chronicle of the whole and sacred history\" from Adam to Cyrus (538 B.C.), hence their English name. Actually, Chronicles is a summary of Hebrew history that duplicates much of Samuel and Kings.",

God has Gad, a seer, tell David to make a choice of punishments from God between 3 years of famine, 3 months of losing battles to enemies, or 3 days of \"the sword of the Lord\", a plague on the land. David leaves it up to God. God sends a plague and kills 70000 men. God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. In the middle of the destruction of Jerusalem, God stopped the angel from going further when he was at the threshing floor of Araunah. David looked up and saw the angel standing between Heaven and Earth with a sword drawn over Jerusalem. David cries out to God, asking why He is punishing the Israelites when it was David that sinned. God tells Gad to tell David to build an altar on Araunah's threshing floor. David asks to buy the threshing floor from Araunah. Araunah says he will just give it to David. David insists on paying, and pays him 600 gold shekels. David built the altar and made burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. God answers David by sending fire from Heaven on the altar.
