"ESV_summary" : "The letter of Jude warns against those who, having gained admission to the church, were perverting the grace of God, denying \"our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ\" (v. 4). Jude used Old Testament examples to warn of these \"blemishes\" on the church. He wrote multiple denunciations of these ungodly people who \"defile the flesh\" and \"reject authority\" (v. 8). He urged Christians to continue in godliness and love toward such people, in some cases reasoning with them, in other cases \"snatching them out of the fire\" (v. 23). Jude closes with one of the most beautiful doxologies in all of Scripture (vv. 24-25). Jude was the brother of James (probably \"James the Lord’s brother,\" Gal. 1:19). He likely wrote sometime between AD 65 and 80.",
"ESV_introduction" : "The author of this short letter warns his readers against the dangers of apostasy, and points to the faithlessness of the Israelites as a reminder of God’s judgment. Surrounded as his readers were by moral corruption and apostacizing influences, the author urges them to \"contend for the faith\" (3), and in a closing benediction he commends them to the One \"who is able to keep you from falling\" (24). Both the similarity of this letter to II Peter and Jude’s use of non-Biblical sources (9,14,15) have been the subject of much discussion.",

"chapter_1_overview" : "Jude, to the elect. Ungodly people pervert grace into sensuality. They are judged as twice dead trees. Build yourselves up in faith.",
"chapter_1_summary" : "Jude introduces himself as a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James. He desired to write about the salvation that the believers shared, but instead urged believers to contend for the faith that has been entrusted to them. He warns them to be careful of false teachers who turn the grace of God into a license for immorality and denying Christ. Jude recalls examples from history, including the Israelites who were delivered from Egypt but later destroyed because of unbelief, and the angels who rebelled and were cast into darkness. He warns that these false teachers will face judgment, while encouraging believers to remain faithful, build themselves up in their faith, and pray in the Holy Spirit. He ends with a doxology, praising God for His glory, majesty, power, and authority.",
