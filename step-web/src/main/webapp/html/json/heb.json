"ESV_summary" : "The letter to the Hebrews was written to encourage Christians in a time of trial. It does so by focusing on the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Jesus Christ. While God spoke in the past \"many times and in many ways,\" he has now spoken to us \"by his Son,\" Jesus Christ, who is the \"exact imprint\" of God’s nature and who \"upholds the universe by the word of his power\" (1:1-3). Jesus accomplished complete salvation for all who trust in him (1:1–10:18). We dare not \"neglect such a great salvation\" (2:3; 5:12–6:20; 10:19-39). Rather, in our faith and in our everyday living, we should imitate the example of Christ and of those on the honor roll of faith (chs. 11–13). This letter, whose author is unknown, was probably written between AD 60 and 70.",
