"ESV_summary" : "First Kings begins with the death of King David (about 970 BC) and the reign of his son, Solomon, who \"excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom\" (10:23). Solomon’s unfaithfulness later in life set the stage for general apostasy among the people. The harsh policies of his son Rehoboam led to the revolt of the northern tribes and the division of Israel. The northern tribes would subsequently be called Israel, while the southern tribes would be called Judah. First Kings describes the construction of the temple in Jerusalem and shows the importance of proper worship. God’s faithfulness to his people is shown as he sent prophets, most notably Elijah, to warn them not to serve other gods. The author of 1 Kings is unknown.",
"ESV_introduction" : "These books are the sequel to I and II Samuel and should be read as a continuation of the history of the Hebrew nation contained in the former work. Originally one book, I and II kings relate the history of Israel form the last days of David to the destruction of the northern kingdom, Israel, in 721 B.C., and to the fall of the southern kingdom, Judah, in 586 B.C. This is the period of Israel’s glory, division, decline, and fall.",

"chapter_1_summary" : "King David couldn't keep warn when he got older, so the Israelites found a beautiful virgin girl, Abishag, to lay with him and attend him, non-sexually. Adonijah takes advantage of David's weak posture and begins to exalt himself as king, and he gathers many supporters. Bathsheba questions David about this, saying that he promised Solomon (their son) shall be king after David. David swears before God that Solomon will be the next king, and then he instructs the anointment and ceremony to make Solomon the king. The anointment and ceremony are carried out, and all the people celebrated saying \"love live King Solomon\". Adonijah hears of this, and grabs the altar for fear that Solomon will kill him. Solomon says if Adonijah proves he is not evil, he will not be harmed.",

David died after ruling for 40 years, 7 in Hebron and 33 in Jerusalem. Adonijah goes to Bathsheba, expresses that he is disgruntled in having lost the kingship, and requests that she ask King Solomon to give Abishag to be Adonijah's wife. Bathsheba asks if Solomon will grant her a small favor, and Solomon says he will grant it. Bathsheba asks for Abishag to be Adonijah's wife as this favor. Solomon has Adonijah killed that day for making the request. Solomon ejects Abiathar from the priesthood for siding with Adonijah during his brief kingship. Solomon has Benaiah kill Joab, requests that Joab's descendants all are punished for Joab's deeds , and appoints Benaiah to command the army. Solomon appoints Zadok as priest to replace Abiathar. Solomon tells Shemei to move to and stay in Jerusalem, or he will be killed. Shemei moves, but later leaves Jerusalem, so Solomon has him killed, saying David's throne will remain secure before God forever.",

"chapter_3_summary" : "King Solomon offers one thousand burnt offerings to God at Gibeon. At night he has a dream in which God asks him what he wants. Solomon tells God he wants wisdom. God says he will give Solomon wisdom, and since he didn't ask for it, God will give him riches and honor, such that there will never be another king like him. God says He will give Solomon long life if he obeys God. Two prostitutes argued in front of Solomon over who owned a baby. Solomon orders the baby be cut in half, to which the baby's mother says give the baby to the other prostitute out of compassion for her child. Solomon orders that the baby be given to the compassionate woman. The Israelites knew this wisdom of judgement must be from God.",

"chapter_6_summary" : "The temple was started 480 years after the Exodus. It was started in the fourth year of Solomon's reign. No iron tool was used at the temple site during construction. God tells Solomon if he will obey God, God will carry out the promise given to David, and God will live with the Israelites and not abandon them. All the stone of the temple was covered with cedar so no stone was seen.

He sacrifices countless sheep and cattle. Then the Ark gets placed into the temple using very long carrying poles, which \"are still there today\". Nothing was in the Ark but the two stone tablets that Moses put there. God enters the temple in the form of a cloud, inhibiting the priests from performing their services. Solomon says that God said \"[God] would dwell in a dark cloud\", and Solomon had said he built a place where God could dwell forever. Solomon blesses the people of Israel, and then prays to God. In his prayer, he asks God to keep His promise that He made to David saying \"[David] shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before Me as you have done.\" In his prayer, he asks God to hear any Israelite when they repent or have dire needs. He also prays that God hear any foreigner that comes to the temple to pray. He says to the Israelites that God has kept all the promises given to Moses.

But if they do not obey and worship other gods, God will remove the Israelites from Israel and reject the temple, causing all other nations to scorn the Israelites for not obeying their God. Solomon gave Hiram 20 towns for helping with the temple construction, but Hiram thought they were \"Cabul\" (good-for-nothing) towns. Solomon made slaves of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites which remained in Israel to construct the God's temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. (The Egyptian Pharaoh had captured Gezer and gave it to Solomon's wife as a wedding present.) Solomon made no Israelite slaves, instead giving them higher positions. Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for God, burning incense before God along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations. Solomon had some some ships built, docked in the Red Sea.",

She gives Solomon lots of spices and gold. Solomon gives her \"all she desired and asked for\" as well and sends her on her way. Solomon's kingdom taxes yielded 666 talents (about 25 tons) of gold each year. There are descriptions of the riches of the kingdom.

"chapter_11_summary" : "Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines. The wives included women from nations that God had forbidden intermarriage with. These wives led Solomon to worship other gods and establish high places for them around Jerusalem. God tells Solomon that He will not punish him directly, but instead will remove all but one tribe of the kingdom from Solomon's heir. Then God raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, who had fled to Egypt when the Edomite men were killed by the Israelites and was married to Pharaoh's sister-in-law, Queen Tahpenes. God raised another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who ruled Aram in Damascus. Ahijah the prophet tells Jeroboam, one of Solomon's officials, that God intends for Jeroboam to rule ten tribes of Israel as king in place of Solomon's successor and that Solomon's successor will rule one tribe so that the Davidic line will not be broken. For an unrecorded reason, Solomon tries to kill Jeroboam, who subsequently flees to Egypt. Jeroboam comes back after Solomon dies. Solomon ruled 40 years total. His son Rehoboam was his successor.",

Against the advice of the elders, Rehoboam says he will make the work even more difficult and demanding. Due to this treatment, only the people of Judah remained loyal to Rehoboam. The rest of the Israelites made Jeraboam their king. This fulfilled God's plan to take the kingdom away from Rehoboam. Rehoboam rallied the people of Judah and Benjamin to regain the kingdom, but God spoke through his prophet Shemaiah and convinced the people not to fight because this was fulfilling God's plan. Jeraboam thinks that if the Israelites worship their God, they will turn again to Rehoboam. So he makes Golden Bulls for them to worship, claiming that they were the gods that brought them out of Egypt. Jeraboam also set up altars, sacrifices, and festivals to these gods. The Israelites worshiped the Golden Bulls.",

"chapter_13_summary" : "A man of God came from Judah to Bethel to an altar where Jeraboam was and proclaimed that a Davidic child by the name of Josiah will sacrifice those that now make offerings at that altar, and proclaimed the altar will be split in two and ashes will be poured on it. When Jeraboam points to the man and directs people to seize him, Jeraboam's hand withers and the altar cracks in two as the man said it would. Jeraboam has the man pray to God to restore the hand, and God does this. Jeraboam invites the man home for dinner, but the man refuses saying God told him not to eat or drink on this journey, and to go home a different way than he arrived there. A prophet from Bethel hears about the altar affair and finds the man of God and invites him back for dinner. The Bethel prophet tells a lie that an angel told him he should feed the man of God. So the man of God went with the prophet. \"The word of the LORD came out of\" the Bethel prophet and told the man that since he disobeyed, he will not be buried in the tomb of his fathers. When the man left to return home, a lion attacked and killed him, and then stood by the body. The Bethel prophet claims the body of the man and buries him in Bethel. Jeraboam continued being evil, and consecrated anyone that wanted to be a priest. This sin led to the house Jeraboam being destroyed from the face of the earth.",

Ahijah tells Jeraboam's wife that God is angry because Jeraboam did not act like David, \"who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes\". Ahijah says God will utterly destroy the house of Jeraboam and uproot and scatter the Israelites across the Euphrates river, and Abijah will die when she returns. Jeraboam reigns for 22 years and then dies, with his son Nadab succeeding him as king. Rehoboam was Solomon's successor for Judah in Jerusalem. Judah eventually began doing all the sins that the land's previous occupants had done, so God was angry. In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and stole all the treasures of the royal palace. There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. Rehoboam died and his son Abijah was his successor.",

Abijah was evil just like his dad, but God still strengthened Jerusalem due to His promise with David. War continued between Judah and the rest of Israel during Abijah's leadership. Abijah died after ruling only 2 years, leaving Asa as king for 41 years. Asa works hard to restore Judah to God's ways. Baasha, king of Israel, makes war with Asa throughout their reigns. Asa sent all the silver and gold he had to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus, in order that Ben-Hadad would break his treaty with Baasha and instead make a treaty with Asa. Ben-Hadad does this and captures several cities in Israel, forcing a retreat of Baasha'a forces. When Asa died, his son Jehoshaphat became king of Judah. In Israel in the third year of Asa's reign of Judah, Baasha performed a successful coup, killing Nadab and becoming king of Israel and ruled for 24 years. Baasha killed everyone in Jeraboam's lineage, because they had done evil in God's eyes, thus fulfilling the prophesy from 1 Kings 14. However, Baasha continues in Jeraboam's evil ways.",

Baasha dies making his son Elah king of Israel in the 26th year of Asa's reign. Zimri performed a successful coup, killing Elah and becoming king of Israel in the 27th year of Asa's reign. Zimri killed everyone in Elah's lineage and their friends, because they had done evil in God's eyes, thus fulfilling the prophesy from earlier in this chapter. When the Israelites heard about Zimri's plot, they proclaimed Omri as their king and laid siege to Tizrah, where Zimri was. At the time Zimri had ruled for seven days, and he died in a fire that he set in the palace at Tizrah because \"of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD and walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in the sin he had committed and had caused Israel to commit\". The people were split between Omri and Tibni for king of Israel, but Omri was stronger and had better support, and thus became king in the 31st year of Asa's reign. Omri sinned more than all the kings of Israel before him. He reigned until his death 7 years later, and his son Ahab became king. Ahab sins even more than Omri, and he reigns 22 years. Ahab marries Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him. During Ahab's rule, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho, its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the God's word revealed by Joshua son of Nun fulfilling the curse in Joshua 6.",

When asked for food and water, the widow says she does not have enough flour and oil. Elijah tells her the flour and oil will not run out until God provides rain, and neither did run out. The widow's son got sick and died. The widow asks Elijah if he came to remind her of her sin and kill her son. Elijah asks God to bring the boy back to life, and God does.

Obadiah fears that Ahab will kill him if Elijah does not show up. Elijah says he will see Ahab that same day. Ahab meets up with Elijah and calls him a trouble starter, but Elijah says that it is Ahab and his family that have caused the trouble. Elijah tells Ahab to gather the people and the prophets of Baal at Mount Carmel, which Ahab does. Elijah challenges the people in a contest to see who is the real God by showing which god will consummate its own burnt offering with fire. The Baal prophets prepared a bull for sacrifice and cried out all day long for Baal to start the fire. Elijah taunts them for the lack of the appearance of their god. At the end of the day, Elijah prepares an altar and a bull for sacrifice. Elijah goes one step further and has water poured on the offering. Then he calls out to God to burn the offering, which God promptly does by sending a fire from heaven. Elijah commands that the Baal prophets be slaughtered. At the first sign of rain, Elijah sends a messenger to Ahab to ride his chariot to Jezreel before the rain stops him.

The Israelites muster a small force divided into two camps. The prophet tells Ahab that God will deliver the Aramean army again because they think God is a god only of the hills and not of the valleys.
