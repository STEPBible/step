"ESV_summary" : "Philemon is about reconciliation and relationships between Christians. Onesimus (which means \"useful\") was a slave of a believer named Philemon in Colossae. Apparently Onesimus had stolen from Philemon and fled. At some time while Paul was under arrest, Onesimus met him and became a Christian. Paul apparently wrote this letter at the same time as Colossians and gave it to Onesimus to carry back to Philemon (see Col. 4:9). Paul appealed to Philemon to accept Onesimus back into his household, but as a brother in the Lord rather than a slave. In Paul’s estimation, Onesimus was far more \"useful\" (v. 11) now that he was a Christian. Paul even promised to pay whatever debt Onesimus might owe Philemon.",
"ESV_introduction" : "This shortest of all Paul’s letters was addressed to Philemon (although two other persons are included in the salutation). Paul entreats Philemon, the master of Onesimus, a runaway slave, to receive him back as a brother in Christ (16, 17). This very personal letter reveals not only the concern of the Apostle for a converted slave but also a practical demonstration of brotherhood in Christ, \"where there is neither bond (slave) nor free\". (Gal 3:28)",
"chapter_1_description" : "Commending Onesimus",
"chapter_1_overview" : "Paul, a prisoner, to Philemon. I ask that you receive Onesimus back, not as a slave, but as a brother. Put his wrongs on my account.",
"chapter_1_summary" : "Paul writes to Philemon, a wealthy Christian and leader in the church, regarding his slave Onesimus, who has escaped from Philemon and has since become a believer while with Paul in prison. Paul refers to Onesimus as \"my very heart\" and asks Philemon to receive him back, not just as a slave but as a beloved brother in Christ. He expresses his willingness to pay any debts that Onesimus owes and emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation, encouraging Philemon to act in accordance with love and to refresh the hearts of believers.",
