"ESV_summary" : "Isaiah lived during the decline of Israel in the shadow of Assyria. He spoke the word of God to a people who were \"deaf and blind\" (see 6:10), who refused to listen to his warnings of looming disaster. He warned that the sin of the people of Judah would bring God’s judgment, yet he also declared that God is sovereign and would use Cyrus the Persian to return them from exile. The book speaks of a \"servant,\" a \"man of sorrows,\" who would be \"pierced for our transgressions,\" accomplishing God’s purposes of salvation (52:13–53:12). The final chapters give a beautiful description of a new creation in which God will rule as King, judging the wicked and establishing eternal peace. Isaiah prophesied about 740–700 BC (possibly till the 680s).",
"ESV_introduction" : "This book, as is true of all the prophetical books, derives its name from the prophet whose messages it records. The unity of Isaiah, a problem related to authorship and contents, has been the subject of much debate. The message of the book is twofold: judgment upon Judah for her sins (1-39), and comfort and hope for an exiled people (40-66). In these messages of encouragement are found some of the most graphic portrayals of the Messiah in the Old Testament.",

"chapter_1_description" : "God will purge the evil from Judah",
"chapter_1_overview" : "The LORD has spoken: I raised children but they have rebelled. Wash yourselves. I will smelt away your dross. Zion shall be redeemed.",
"chapter_1_summary" : "Isaiah, son of Amoz, had the following vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem during the reigns of the kings of Judah Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Isaiah says that God says: God has reared up children which rebel against Him. Isaiah says that the Israelites are full of evil and will not yield to God despite His attempts to punish them, and now they are physically injured, their country is desolate, and their fields are stripped. If it wasn't for God sparing some of them, they would all be dead. Isaiah says that God says: God has had enough burnt offerings and asks who asked them to make these sacrifices? Stop bringing meaningless sacrifices. God hates their festivals, Sabbaths, and appointed feasts. God will not listen to your prayers. Purify yourself, be righteous, seek justice, and defend the oppressed, orphans, and widows. Though the Israelites are stained with scarlet sins, they will be purified white as snow again and be rewarded if they obey God. But if they don't obey, they will be killed by the sword. Jerusalem has become a whore, and everything has been corrupted. God declares that He will purge the evil and restore the judges like in the days before kings, and Zion (Jerusalem) will again be righteous. God will redeem the righteous but will punish the rebels and sinners.",

"chapter_2_overview" : "The mountain of the LORD will be established. On that day the pride of men will be humbled. They will flee the splendour of the LORD.",
"chapter_2_summary" : "Isaiah, son of Amoz, had the following vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem. In the last days, God's mountain temple will be established in Jerusalem, and God will judge, teach, and settle the disputes of many nations, such that swords will be turned to plowshares and there will no longer be any wars. The people of the house of Jacob are wealthy, have pagan practices, and worship idols, but God will humble them. Hide from the wrath of God. God has a day planned when all arrogant men will be humbled and God alone will be exalted. Idols will disappear on that day. On that day, men will throw away their idols and try to hide from God's wrath. Stop trusting in man.",
"chapter_3_description" : "*In the last days, God will humble Judah and leave only a remnant",
"chapter_3_overview" : "The LORD will take away all support from Judah. Children will govern. You grind the faces of the poor. The women of Zion are proud.",
"chapter_3_summary" : "God is about to remove all food, water, and leaders from Jerusalem and Judah. Children will lead and govern. Neighbors will fight each other. No one will want to rule. This will happen because they have been proud of their sins. The righteous will be rewarded at that time. God will punish the elders and the leaders for creating this evil and oppressing the poor. The Israelite women act and dress seductively, so God will give them sores and make them bald. God will take all of their jewelery. God will make them stinky, bald, branded, and poorly dressed. Men will die in battle.",

"chapter_4_summary" : "In that day, women will be so desperate for marriage that seven women will marry one man only for his namesake. The survivors will inherit a beautiful and glorious land and will be called holy after God has purged and cleansed Jerusalem with a spirit of judgement and a spirit of fire. Then God will make a canopy of smoke by day and fire by night to protect the land.",

"chapter_5_overview" : "Why did my vineyard yield wild grapes? Woe to those who pursue drink, who call evil good. The anger of the LORD is against his people.",
"chapter_5_summary" : "In a vineyard metaphor, Isaiah says that God set up Israel in the best country using the best people to start things off. However, the result has been bad, so God will destroy it. God will punish wealthy landowners by making their crop production drop. Woe to the drunkards. The Israelites have parties without respect to God, so they will be sent into exile and many will die in the process. Mankind will be humbled, God will be exalted by His justice, and sheep will feed in the ruins. Woe to those that seek a quick resolution of God's plan, to those that deceive, to the arrogant wise, to drunkards, to those that take bribes and deny justice. God will punish the Israelites with deadly earthquakes until bodies litter the streets, and He has called other nations to attack them, and these nations are on their way. God will see to it that the other nations are successful in attacking the Israelites.",
"chapter_6_description" : "God has Isaiah curse the Israelites to leave only a remnant",
"chapter_6_overview" : "I saw the LORD seated on high. A seraph brought a coal to my lips. The LORD said, \"Who will go for us?\" I said, \"Here am I; send me!\"",
"chapter_6_summary" : "In the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah had a vision of God on a throne in a temple with six-winged seraphs flying above Him. They hid their faces with two wings, hid their feet with two wings, and flew with the last pair of wings. They praised God, and the Temple filled with smoke. Isaiah feared that he was guilty, but a seraph touched Isaiah's mouth with a hot coal and told him that his guilt was taken away and his sin was atoned. God tells Isaiah to tell the Israelites to hear but not understand, see but not perceive, make them calloused and stubborn so that they will not change their minds and thus be healed. Isaiah asked how long should this happen. God replies until the land is destroyed, but a tenth of the population will remain there and as a holy seed.",
"chapter_7_description" : "*Immanuel will be born, then the Assyrians will conquer nations",
"chapter_7_overview" : "Aram plotted with Ephraim. The LORD sent Isaiah to King Ahaz: Behold, a virgin shall bear a son. The LORD will use Assyria as a razor.",
"chapter_7_summary" : "When Ahaz was king of Judah, Aram allied with Israel to attack Judah. God tells Isaiah to tell Ahaz that Aram and Israel will not be successful in conquering Judah. God (implicitly) tells Isaiah to ask Ahaz what sign he would like from God as proof that he will not be conquered. Ahaz rejects the question, not wanting to test God. (Implicitly) God angrily responds through Isaiah that Ahaz is trying God's patience, and God will give them a sign: that a virgin (literally \"a young woman\") will give birth to a son called Immanuel (God with us). Immanuel will eat curds and honey until he knows right from wrong. But before the boy is that mature, the two attacking kings will be laid to waste. God will then bring the king of Assyria to invade Judah. God will fill the land with Egyptian flies and Assyrian bees. The Assyrian king will shave them. Cows and goats will produce a lot of milk, so the people will eat curds and honey. God will fill the vineyards and fields with briers and thorns so that they will be afraid to farm there.",
"chapter_8_description" : "*Immanuel will be born, then the Assyrians will conquer nations",
"chapter_8_overview" : "The floodwaters of Assyria will overflow the land. Many will fall and be snared. I will trust in the LORD. They will curse their gods.",
"chapter_8_summary" : "God tells Isaiah to write on a scroll \"quick to the plunder swift to the spoils\". Isaiah has sex with a prophetess who bears a son, and God told Isaiah to name him quick to the plunder swift to the spoils, and that before the boy can talk Damascus and Samaria will be plundered by the king of Assyria. God tells Isaiah that because the people of Aram have rejected Shiloah, God will bring the king of Assyria against them and they will not be able to do anything about it because God [is] with us. God tells Isaiah to fear and dread Him, and He will be a Sanctuary. But for the Israelites, God will be a stone that trips them and a snare that traps them. Isaiah says that he will trust God. Isaiah says that those who do not consult with God will see only distress, darkness, and gloom.",
"chapter_9_description" : "Mighty God will rule forever after Israel is destroyed",
"chapter_9_overview" : "A child is born to us. His government will increase forever. The LORD will raise the enemies of Israel. His anger has not turned away.",
"chapter_9_summary" : "But there will be an end to the dimness for the anguished; the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali who were lightly afflicted and afterward heavily punished by Gentiles from across the Jordan River and beyond Galilee. (Alternate Translation: But there will be an end to the dimness for the anguished. In the future, God will honor the Gentiles beyond Galilee and across the Jordan River.) People in darkness have seen a great light. You (which is not defined as to who this is) have made the nation bigger, increased joy, and lifted peoples burdens. War-bloodied clothing will be burnt. A son is born who will rule and be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His peace and government will know no end, and he will rule from David's throne in justice and righteousness forever. God is angry with Israel for their pride and arrogance, and will have them conquered in a single day. God will not pity orphans or widows because everybody in Israel is wicked. God will scorch the land, incite brother to fight against brother, and bring them to cannibalism.",
"chapter_10_description" : "Mighty God will destroy the Assyrians and call back the remnant",
"chapter_10_overview" : "Woe to those who rob the poor of justice. Woe to Assyria, whose purpose is to destroy. The remnant of Israel will return to the LORD.",
"chapter_10_summary" : "Woe to the unjust and the oppressors, they will see a day of reckoning where they will cower or die. Woe to the king of Assyria. God sent him to conquer Judah, but he will be punished for thinking that it is through his strength that he has done this. God will punish his soldiers with disease, and the \"Light of Israel\" will destroy his nation in a single day. In that day, the Israelite remnants will return to Mighty God. God tells the remnant that very soon His wrath will end against them and will turn to the Assyrians and will destroy them.",

"chapter_11_overview" : "A shoot will come up from Jesse. He will judge with righteousness. The wolf will live with the lamb. The Lord will gather his people.",
"chapter_11_summary" : "A man will come from the family of Jesse, and the spirit of God will be with that man. He will be righteous and wise, have delight in and fear of God, and will speak condemning, righteous justice. Weak animals will live peacefully with strong animals, and carnivores will become vegetarians. All the earth will know God. All nations will rally behind this \"root of Jesse\", and God will gather the remnant Israelites back from Egypt, Cush, Elam, Baylonia, Hamath, the islands, and all the earth. The people of Israel and the people of Judah again will be at peace making a unified Israelite nation. They will capture Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites. God will dry up the Egyptian sea and break the Euphrates into seven shallow streams, and create a path for the Israelites.",
"chapter_12_description" : "*The Root of Jesse will gather back the remnant",
"chapter_12_overview" : "In that day you will say: I will praise you, O LORD! Your anger has turned away. Surely God is my salvation. Sing for joy, O Zion!",

"chapter_13_overview" : "The oracle concerning Babylon: Listen! The LORD is calling an army. I will punish the world for its evil. Babylon will be overthrown.",
"chapter_13_summary" : "This is a prophesy for Babylon as seen by Isaiah. God is bringing massive armies from far away against Babylon to destroy the country. They will attack on the day of God to enact His wrath. People will be terrorized and writhe in pain. The day of God will be cruel with wrath and anger, destroying sinners. There will be no light from the stars, the sun, or the moon. God will punish the world for their wicked sins and put an end to haughty arrogance and ruthless pride. Afterwards, mankind's population will be scarce. Heaven and earth will shake. People will flee to their homelands. Anyone caught will be killed, their children will be killed, and their wives will be raped. God will send the Medes to make this merciless attack on Babylon. Babylon will never again be inhabited except by wild animals. The time for this is soon.",
"chapter_14_description" : "*Babylon will be destroyed and Israel will be restored and rule all nations",
"chapter_14_overview" : "The LORD will again choose Israel. How you are fallen, O Lucifer! You will be cast away like a trampled corpse. Wail, O Philistia!",
"chapter_14_summary" : "God will bring the Israelites back to Israel, and they will rule over other nations and their former oppressors. They are to taunt the king of Babylon after this happens. God has conquered the wicked and the land is at peace. The dead will mock the newly killed king of Babylon. The king of Babylon had arrogant ambitions but is now brought down to common death. Onlookers wonder at Babylon's fall. The king of Babylon will not be buried in his nation because there will be no nation left. Slaughter the king's sons for the sins of their forefathers so that they will have no inheritance. God will utterly destroy Babylonian nation and turn it into an owl-filled swamp. God, according to His plan for the whole world, will crush the Assyrians for oppressing his people, and nobody can stop Him. Below is a prophesy as seen by Isaiah in the year that King Ahaz died. God will inflict plague on the Philistines and have the Israelites attack them.",

"chapter_16_summary" : "Send tribute to Israel. Hide the Moabite fugitives until God has stopped destroying them. In Israel, the throne will be established in love, faithfulness, justice, and righteousness by someone of Davidic lineage. Moab was prideful, so they will wail and grieve. Their crops will be ruined, and nobody will be shouting for joy at the harvest. This will happen within three years.",

"chapter_17_summary" : "Isaiah gets a prophecy that Damascus will be destroyed. The fortified city of Ephraim will disappear. Aram will be reduced to a remnant like the Israelites that broke from Judah. Then Jacob will be reduced to a remnant too. Then people will turn to God and turn away from idols, and their fortified cities will be abandoned. They have forgotten the Savior, the Rock, God, so God will destroy their harvest and give them disease and pain. Many nations will be destroyed in a single night.",

God will make the Egyptians fight amongst themselves, make all their plans fail, be ruled by a fiercely cruel king, and experience a drought so bad that the Nile will dry up and all of the crops will be destroyed. Additionally God will make all of the Egyptian leaders and wise men fools. The Egyptians will cower like women at the mention of Judah because of what God has planned for them. At that time five Egyptian cities will speak the Canaanite language and swear allegiance to God. At that time there will be an altar to God put in the heart of Egypt and a monument to God put at its border. When the Egyptians cry out to God, He will send them a Savior. The Egyptians will sacrifice to God. God will attack them with a plague and then heal them. At that time, Egypt, Israel, and the Assyrians will all worship God together and be a blessing to the earth.",

"chapter_22_summary" : "Isaiah gets a prophecy about Jerusalem, the Valley of Vision. God is wondering why there is so much commotion when they were captured without bloodshed and their leaders were taken away. God has a day of terror planned for Jerusalem brought on by the Elamites and the Medes. The Israelites changed Jerusalem in the process of trying to rebuild its defences without consideration that God had designed Jerusalem. God had made Jerusalem to become captured to provoke repentance, but instead the Israelites had a party because they thought they would die the next day. For as long as they live this sin will not be atoned for. The king's steward, Shebna, is going to be sent to a foreign country and disgraced. God will make Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, take Shebna's place and give him great honor and athority. What Eliakim opens, nobody can shut, and what he shuts nobody can open.",

Because people defile the earth by breaking laws and \"the everlasting covenant\", God will curse the earth, burning people until there is only a remnant left. Nobody will be cheerful or happy. The city will be ruined. The remnant will joyfully praise God. For the others, there will be no escape from God's wrath. The earth will fracture and shake violently, and mankind will never recover.

In Jerusalem God will prepare a feast for everybody, with the best meat and wine. From Jerusalem, God will set up a one world government.

"chapter_26_summary" : "At that time people in Judah will sing a song saying: Jerusalem is fortified by God's salvation. Trust in God and have peace. God humbles mighty men. We follow God's laws and seek Him. People learn righteousness when God judges the earth, but the wicked do not learn their lesson. Let God's fire burn the wicked. We don't honor our past kings, we only honor God as our king. The dead kings are punished and wiped from our memory. God has made His/our nation become (or instead \"become honored in\" according to a more literal interpretation) the whole world. We have worked in pain like a pregnant woman, but have have not really produced anything substantial, such as salvation or life. (As best as I can discern studying the different translations of the Bible, Isaiah 26:19-21 could be interpreted essentially two different ways. Both are included here, numbered 1 and 2. I favor 1 because of how the reanimated dead are supposed to shout for joy [in the sense that the sins against them will finally be punished] and the earth is supposed to be a witness of their blood, but most scholars probably favor 2 because of the closer tie in with the final judgement of Christian theology.) {1} We should hide indoors for a little while, because God will resurrect those which had their blood wrongfully shed and take vengeance on those of whom are responsible. {2} All of the dead will live again. We should hide indoors for a little while, because God will unleash His wrath on all of the sinners.",

God will battle enemies but will accept the peaceful in peace. The Israelites will fill the earth with their fruit. God has punished the Israelites, but not as severely as He has punished those people which attacked the Israelites. The Israelites' sin will be removed when all of the idol altars are destroyed and Jerusalem is abandoned and destroyed. God will show them no mercy because they do not obey Him.

Ephriam's priests are corrupt and distort God's teachings. Therefore God will have foreigners speak to the people because they would not listen to Him. God will let them continue in their evil so that they will be ensnared and punished. God tells the leaders of Jerusalem, who have made covenants with idols for protection, that He has set down the foundation of Jerusalem such that it will have justice and righteousness.

This is because the Israelites say they honor God but do not in their hearts, and they follow men's rules instead of God's rules. So God will humble the wise and intelligent. Nobody can hide what they do from God. Nobody has the right to question God. Shorty the known world will be changed. At that time the Israelites will understand this prophesy and will worship God. All of the evil people will be killed. The Israelites will be proud again, worshiping God in His awesomeness. Wayward people will then understand and follow God.",

"chapter_30_summary" : "God is angry that Judah as made an alliance with Egypt without consulting God, and therefore will disgrace them by making the alliance ineffective. God calls Egypt an arrogant do-nothing. God tells Isaiah to write it down as witness forever. The Israelites will not follow God and choose not to listen to His prophets. Therefore, God will shatter their nation. God told them to rest and repent for salvation, that quietness and trust was their strength, but they would not listen. Instead they have chosen to flee, so God will scatter them until they are defenceless. But God wants to show them grace, and blessed are those that wait for God. When Jerusalem cries for help, God will be quick to help them. God will guide them, and they will discard their idols. God will bless their crops and livestock. At that time they will have plentiful rivers and extra-bright daylight and moonlight. God is full of wrath, and He destroys nations and leads them astray. The Israelites will rejoice in God.

Mankind has produced nothing worthwhile and they speak evil, so they will be burned. Those far away should take heed and those near God should acknowledge His power. God scares the Godless. Then the righteous will dwell in Jerusalem with God, where God will supply bread and water without fail. Those then in Jerusalem will observe a beautiful king and vast nation, and will wonder what has become of the leaders from before the destruction. They will never again be ruled by foreigners.

"chapter_36_summary" : "In King Hezekiah's fourteenth year of reigning Judah, the king of Assyria, Sennacherib, captured all of the cities of Judah and then besieged Jerusalem. The Assyrian army's commander spoke to leaders of Jerusalem, Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah, and mocked them for putting up resistance. He mocked them depending on Egypt for support, and mocked them for depending on God for support when it was God Himself that told them to attack and destroy Judah. He tells them to bargain for peace. The leaders of Jerusalem told the Assyrian army commander to speak in Aramaic instead of Hebrew so that the other Israelites would not understand. However, the Assyrian army commander continued in Hebrew and spoke specifically to the other Israelites, telling them that they will have to eat and drink their own feces and urine if they don't surrender. He tells them not to believe what Hezekiah tells them. He tells them that if they surrender, they will be treated well. He tells them not to believe that God can save them, because the gods of other countries were not able to save those countries from being captured. The leaders of Jerusalem told Hezekiah what the commander said. (Cross-reference 2 Kings 18)",

"chapter_37_summary" : "Upon hearing the message, Hezekiah donned sackcloth and consulted with the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah tells him not to worry because Sennacherib has blasphemed and therefore God will cause him to return to his own country and be killed. Sennacherib hears that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, is marching against him, so he sends another taunting message to Hezekiah. When Hezekiah gets the letter he prays to God, who is enthroned between the cherubim, to deliver them. Isaiah prophesies a message for Sennacherib that, while he has conquered much of the land, it is because God planned it that way. God says that Hezekiah will eat from the wild foods for 2 years, but in 3 years he will be back to sowing and reaping. God says that Sennacherib will not enter or siege Jerusalem because God will defend it for His sake and the sake of David. That night an angel of God killed 185000 of Sennacherib's men, so Sennacherib withdrew. One day while he was praying to his god, Sennacherib's sons killed him. Sennacherib's son Esarhaddon succeeded him. (Cross-reference 2 Kings 19)",

Isaiah told him that because of his prayer and tears, God will heal him, and when he goes up to the Temple 3 days from now, God will add 15 years to his life. Furthermore, God will deliver Judah from Assyria. Isaiah had God move a shadow back ten steps on a stairway as a sign. Hezekiah wrote a poem about his illness and recovery saying that God will kill him and he will not see God again \"in the land of the living\", that like a lion God broke all his bones and because God has said that he will die there is nothing he can do but submit to God's will. He goes on to say God saved him and healed him, saying that it must have been for his benefit that God made him suffer. He says that God forgave all of his sins. He says the dead can't praise God once they are dead, but the living praise God, as he is doing today. Isaiah had a poultice of figs put on Hezekiah's boil to heal it.

There will never again be people that die early; someone that dies before reaching 100 years old will be thought to have been cursed. Everyone there will enjoy the fruits of their labor because God will bless them and their descendants. God will help them before they even ask for help. Predatory animals will no longer eat prey, and snakes will eat dust and never harm anyone in Jerusalem.",
"chapter_66_description" : "*God will create the new heaven and the new earth",
"chapter_66_overview" : "Listen! The LORD is repaying his enemies. Rejoice with Jerusalem and be comforted. All flesh will worship before me, says the LORD.",
"chapter_66_summary" : "God has made the earth and the heavens. God esteems a humble, God-fearing man. Those that sacrifice animals, give grain offerings, and burn incense are like the pagans, and so God will punish them for not listening to Him. The enemies of the Israelites will be destroyed by God. God will re-establish Israel in one day. Israel will be richly blessed by God. When the Israelites see this, they will know God. God will punish His enemies with fire and His sword, and will kill many people; pagans and those that eat unclean meats alike. All the nations will come to Israel and see God's glory. God will send the survivors of His wrath to distant nations to proclaim God's glory. Then the distant nations will bring back to Israel the exiled Israelites in their countries. The new heavens and earth will last forever, and their descendants will forever possess Israel. The Israelites will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those which have rebelled against God.",
