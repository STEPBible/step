"ESV_summary" : "The letter of Jude warns against those who, having gained admission to the church, were perverting the grace of God, denying \"our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ\" (v. 4). Jude used Old Testament examples to warn of these \"blemishes\" on the church. He wrote multiple denunciations of these ungodly people who \"defile the flesh\" and \"reject authority\" (v. 8). He urged Christians to continue in godliness and love toward such people, in some cases reasoning with them, in other cases \"snatching them out of the fire\" (v. 23). Jude closes with one of the most beautiful doxologies in all of Scripture (vv. 24-25). Jude was the brother of James (probably \"James the Lord’s brother,\" Gal. 1:19). He likely wrote sometime between AD 65 and 80.",
"ESV_introduction" : "The author of this short letter warns his readers against the dangers of apostasy, and points to the faithlessness of the Israelites as a reminder of God’s judgment. Surrounded as his readers were by moral corruption and apostacizing influences, the author urges them to \"contend for the faith\" (3), and in a closing benediction he commends them to the One \"who is able to keep you from falling\" (24). Both the similarity of this letter to II Peter and Jude’s use of non-Biblical sources (9,14,15) have been the subject of much discussion.",
