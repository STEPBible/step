The first script is extract_def.pl.  You need to provide the name of the Greek or the Hebrew lexicon files which are in the STEPBible Github repository.  
The lexicon_greek.txt and lexicon_hebrew.txt files are in the STEP github repository.  They are under the step-core-data\src\main\resources\com\tyndalehouse\step\core\data\create\lexicon folder.  

The extract_def.pl script will create four files:

1. lexicon_greek.txt.strong.tsv
2. lexicon_greek.txt.gloss.tsv
3. lexicon_greek.txt.def.tsv
4. lexicon_greek.txt.orig.string

The second script (convert_def.pl) will use the Google translated gloss and definitions and put them in multiple JSON files.

Procedure:

1. Run the first perl script. For example, perl extract_def.pl lexicon_greek.txt.  
2. Open a new Google Sheet with the name GreekDef_ar
3. Copy content of first file to column A.
4. Copy content of second file to column B
5. Copy content of third file to column D
6. In cell C1, add a formula of =googletranslate(b1, "en", "fr")
7. Copy C1 to all other cells in column C
8. In cell E1, add a formula of =googletranslate(d1, "en", "fr")
9. Copy E1 to all other cells in column E
10. Work on something else for an hour or two.  It takes 30 to 60 minutes for Google to translate all the cells.  
11. Verify none of the cells contains the text, "Loading".  Download the Google sheet to your PC as a "Tab Separated Values" file.  I usually download it as GreekDef_fr.tsv.  The "_fr" in the file name tells the second script to convert the Bible book names using the French language.  For example, John 3:16 will become Jean 3:16 in French.  
12. Create a subfolder json_ar so the second script will output about 10 thousand json files there.
13. Run the second perl script.  For example, perl convert_def.pl GreekDef_fr.tsv lexicon_greek.txt.orig.string.  The first parameter is the file downloaded with the Google translation.  The second parameter is the fourth file generated by the first script.  That file has all the strings that were not provided to Google to translate.  For example, transliteration and references are not provided to Google translate.  The second script will try to convert the book names in the Bible reference.  For example, from John to Jean, Genesis to Genèse.  The second script will reinsert the strings back to the definition.
14. If you put the gloss and definitions, you have already translated into a file like PatrickGreekDef_fr.tsv, you would run the second script after step 13.  That will override the Google translate gloss/definitions with your gloss/definitions.  For example, perl convert_def.pl PatrickGreekDef_ar.tsv.

The process for Hebrew gloss and definition is the same.  The main change is the first input file name is lexicon_hebrew.txt.  The output file names I then create would have something like HebrewDef_fr.

There is also a bookName.pl that contains the name of Bible books in different languages.  For example:

$langBook{"ar-Gen"} = "تكوين";
$langBook{"ar-Exod"} = "خروج";
$langBook{"ar-Lev"} = "لاويين";
$langBook{"ar-Num"} = "عدد";
$langBook{"ar-Deut"} = "تثنية";
$langBook{"ar-Josh"} = "يشوع";
