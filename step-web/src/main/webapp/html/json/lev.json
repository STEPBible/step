"ESV_summary" : "Leviticus begins with the people of Israel at the foot of Mount Sinai. The glory of the Lord had just filled the tabernacle (Ex. 40:34-38) and God now tells Moses to instruct the Levitical priests and the people of Israel concerning sacrifices, worship, the priesthood, ceremonial cleanness, the Day of Atonement, feasts and holy days, and the Year of Jubilee. The central message is that God is holy and he requires his people to be holy. The book also shows that God graciously provides atonement for sin through the shedding of blood. Traditionally, Jews and Christians recognize Moses as the author, writing sometime after the giving of the Law.",
"ESV_introduction" : "This book was so named because it treats of laws of service and worship of special importance to the Tribe of Levi. It has been aptly called \"the Handbook of the Priests\". Many basic precepts of the New Testament are foreshadowed in this book, such as the seriousness of sin in Godâ€™s sight, the necessity of atonement for sin, the holiness of God, and the necessity of a mediator between God and man.",

"chapter_1_description" : "How to make burnt offerings",
"chapter_1_overview" : "Whoever brings a burnt offering should slaughter a bull, a sheep, a goat or a bird. The priest shall burn it on the altar to the LORD.",
"chapter_1_summary" : "God tells Moses how to make burnt flesh offerings. If the offering is a bull, it must be without defect, and the person making the offering is to lay his hand on the bulls head to signify it for atonement of sins. The blood will be put on the altar. All parts are to be burned. Sheep or goats without defect can be offered. Doves or young pigeons can be offered, though the crop of the bird is to be thrown on the ashes instead of burned. The smell of burnt flesh pleases God.",
"chapter_2_description" : "How to make grain offerings",
"chapter_2_overview" : "A grain offering should be fine flour with oil and incense. The priest shall burn a portion. The rest belongs to Aaron and his sons.",

Its blood is to be sprinkled in front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. The bull's fat and kidneys are to be burnt at the altar, while the rest of the bull is to be burnt outside the camp. If the community sins unintentionally, even if they didn't know it was a sin and later found out about it, the process is the same except all of the elders of the community lay their hands on the bull's head. If a leader unintentionally sins, then the same process is followed except a male goat is used and no seven sprinklings are needed (or at least they are not explicitly required). If a community member unintentionally sins, then the process is the same as for the leader, except a female goat or female sheep is to be used.",

If that person can't afford a lamb or goat, then two pigeons or doves are to be used. If that person can't afford two pigeons or doves, then fine flour is to be used. If a person unintentionally sins against holy things, a ram of proper value must be offered, and a fifth of the value is to be given to the priests. If a person unintentionally sins he must offer a ram without defect and of proper value.",

Moses says that priests cannot mourn those killed by God, such as by tearing their clothes or uncovering their heads, but the rest of the nation can mourn; otherwise those priests will be killed. God tells Aaron that the priests cannot have a fermented drink in the Tent of Meeting or they will be killed; and that they must teach the people what is clean and unclean, as well as all of God's commandments. The priests made a sin offering, but burnt it all. Moses is angered that they did not eat any of the offering. Aaron says he could not eat any because of what had just happened.",
