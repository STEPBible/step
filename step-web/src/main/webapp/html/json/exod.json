"ESV_summary" : "Exodus tells of God fulfilling his promise to Abraham by multiplying Abraham’s descendants into a great nation, delivering them from slavery in Egypt, leading them to the Promised Land, and then binding them to himself with a covenant at Mount Sinai. Moses, under the direct command of God and as leader of Israel, received the Ten Commandments from God, along with other laws governing Israel’s life and worship. He also led the nation in the building of the tabernacle, a place where God’s presence dwelled among his people and where they made sacrifices for sin. Traditionally, Jews and Christians recognize Moses as the author, writing sometime after the Exodus from Egypt.",
"ESV_introduction" : "The name means \"going out\" or departure\". While it refers to one of the most important events of the book, the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, other highly significant events are also found here, such as the oppression of the Chosen People in Egypt, the flight and call of Moses, and God’s covenant with the nation Israel at Sinai - an experience climaxed by His giving of the moral law (Ten Commandments) through Moses to the people. A code of secular laws is also included, and the latter part of the book contains an elaborate description of the sacred Ark of the Covenant and its ten (tabernacle), God’s place of dwelling among His people.",

"chapter_1_summary" : "There is some information about Israel's lineage that went to Egypt. All of Joseph's generation had passed away when a new king came to power in Egypt as Pharaoh. This new king feared the numbers of Israelites. Pharaoh put the Hebrews under hard labor in their slavery, but their numbers still increased. Pharaoh then ordered the midwives to kill the boys born of the Hebrews. The midwives feared God, so they did not kill the boys. God rewards the midwives with families. Pharaoh decreed that all males born of the Hebrews shall be thrown in the Nile.",

"chapter_2_overview" : "Pharaoh's daughter found a Hebrew baby by the river. She named him Moses. When he grew up, Moses killed an Egyptian and fled to Midian.",
"chapter_2_summary" : "A Levite couple had a baby boy. The mother hides him for three months, then puts him into a water-worthy basket in the reeds in the Nile. The daughter of Pharaoh finds the crying baby in the basket and takes pity on it. Pharaoh's daughter pays the Levite mother to nurse the boy. After nursing, the boy was given to Pharaoh's daughter as her son, and she named him Moses. When Moses was older, he killed an Egyptian man that was oppressing the Hebrews. Moses thought he had done this secretly. The next day when Moses questioned two Hebrews which were fighting each other, one of them asked Moses if Moses would kill him too. Realizing that his deeds were discovered, Moses fled to Midian, narrowly escaping a death by Pharaoh's orders. At a well in Midian, Moses rescued seven daughters of a Priest which were being harassed by some shepherds. Their father gave one of the daughters, Zipporah, to Moses in marriage. They had a son named Gershom. The Egyptian king died. The Israelites complained of the slavery. God heard these complaints and remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob/Israel.",

God told Moses to remove his sandals because he was on was Holy ground. God told Moses that He had heard the Israelites' complaints and was concerned about their suffering. God told Moses that the \"LORD\", roughly \"I AM\" in Hebrew, is the name by which God will be known. God told Moses to tell the Israelite elders that \"I AM\" has sent Moses to lead them out of Egypt to the land of milk and honey, the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. God told Moses that Moses must tell Pharaoh to let his people go into the desert for three days to make sacrifices to God. God said that He knows that Pharaoh will not let the people go unless God compels him to do so. So God says He will influence Pharaoh to let the people go. God will also make the Egyptian give their riches to the Israelites, thereby plundering Egypt.",

When Moses complains that he is not eloquent, God gets angry and tells Moses that his brother, Aaron, can help him speak to Pharaoh. God tells Moses that the people in Egypt that wanted to kill him are now dead. God tells Moses to tell Pharaoh to let his people go into the desert for three days for a ceremony for God and that Moses should perform the miracles for Pharaoh. God says that He will harden the Pharaoh's heart so that Pharaoh will not let the people go. Then God says Moses should tell Pharaoh that because he will not let the Israelites go, God will kill Pharaoh's first-born son. On the way to Egypt, God met him but Zipporah circumcises Gershom so God did not kill him. God tells Aaron to meet with Moses. Moses tells Aaron everything. Moses and Aaron meet with the elders and showed the miracles, and the elders believed what Moses said. The elders bowed and worshiped God.",

That day Pharaoh decrees the Israelites will have to get their own straw for making bricks, but their brick production quota will not be reduced. The slave drivers carry out the orders, and then beat the Israelite foremen when they can't meet the quota. The foremen complain to Pharaoh, but he doesn't listen. When the foremen saw Moses and Aaron, they blamed Moses and Aaron for inciting Pharaoh's harsh treatment of the Hebrews. Moses asks God why He has let this suffering occur.",

God says that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not know God by the name \"LORD\" as Moses now knows God. God tells Moses to tell the Israelites this, and that He will deliver them to the promised land. Moses tells the Israelites, but they do not believe him because of their suffering. God then tells Moses to tell Pharaoh again to let the Israelites go, which prompts Moses to ask why would Pharaoh listen him given that he's not a good speaker. Then there is some lineage information about Moses and Aaron. God again tells Moses to talk to Pharaoh, but Moses again asks why Pharaoh would listen to him.",

But God says He will harden the Pharaoh's heart so that Pharaoh will not let the people go despite the many signs He will manifest. Then God will bring vengeance and judgment upon the Egyptians so that they will know God and push the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses was 80 years old and Aaron 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh. Aaron turns the staff into a snake. Pharaoh's wise men, sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians were able to duplicate this trick. Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he dismissed Moses and Aaron. God tells Moses to meet Pharaoh at the Nile in the morning and tell Pharaoh that because he will not let the Israelites go, God will turn the water in Egypt to blood; the fish will die, the river will stink, and the water will be not be drinkable. God instructs that then Moses should tell Aaron to raise his staff over the waters of Egypt and they will turn to blood. Moses and Aaron did this. Egyptian magicians were able to duplicate this.

God tells Moses to tell Aaron to raise his staff over the waters to cause this plague. Moses and Aaron did this. Frogs were everywhere. Egyptian magicians were able to duplicate this. Pharaoh asked Moses and Aaron to pray to God to stop the frog plague. Moses prays and the frogs die (except those in the Nile). The land stunk of dead frogs. Pharaoh's heart hardened and he dismissed Moses and Aaron again. God tells Moses to tell Aaron to strike the ground with his staff, which would cause the dust Egypt to become gnats. Moses and Aaron did this. Egyptian magicians were not able to duplicate this and claimed that this was God's doing. Pharaoh's heart was hard and he didn't let the Israelites go. God tells Moses to tell Pharaoh that if he does not let the Israelites go, God will bring a plague of flies, but the flies will only pester the Egyptians. Moses and God did this. Pharaoh asked Moses and Aaron to pray to God so that the fly plague stops, and says he will let the Israelites go. Moses prays. The plague stops.

"chapter_9_summary" : "God tells Moses to tell Pharaoh that if he does not let the Israelites go, God will kill all the Egyptians' livestock tomorrow. Pharaoh doesn't listen, so God kills all the Egyptians' livestock. Pharaoh's heart was hard and he didn't let the Israelites go. God tells Moses and Aaron for Moses to toss soot into the air near Pharaoh. The soot would then become dust that causes boils on all [Egyptian] people and [Egyptian] animals in Egypt. Moses tossed the soot and boils broke out. God hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he would not listen to Moses and Aaron. God tells Moses to tell Pharaoh that if he does not let the Israelites go, God will send the worst hail storm ever in Egypt's history tomorrow, and to tell Pharaoh to give an order to bring all livestock and other valuables under shelter. Moses did this. The God-fearing people sheltered things and livestock. Others ignored the warning. The hail storm came everywhere in Egypt except Goshen. Pharaoh asked Moses and Aaron to pray to God to stop the hail. Moses prays. The hail stops. When the hail stopped, Pharaoh sinned again and hardened his heart.

Moses and Aaron tell Pharaoh that if he does not let the Israelites go, God will send a plague of locust to devour all the plants. Then they leave. Pharaoh's advisers advise to let the Israelites go. Pharaoh says only the men can go. God tells Moses to stretch his hand over Egypt to start the Locust plague, and he does. Not a single part of green is left on any plant. Pharaoh begs forgiveness from Moses. Moses prays. The locusts get blown away. God hardens Pharaoh's heart so he wouldn't let the Israelites go. God tells Moses to stretch his hand to the sky so that total darkness would fall upon Egypt, and he did. Darkness lasted for three days. The Israelites still had light during that time. Pharaoh summoned Moses and said that everyone but the livestock can go. Moses said that is no good. Pharaoh told Moses to leave, and not to come back.",

No yeast can be in the house and you can eat nothing with yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day to the evening of the twenty-first day. Cut off anyone who has yeast in this time. Do no work on the fourteenth or the twenty-first. At midnight, God killed the first born of men and cattle of the Egyptians.

God will harden Pharaoh's heart so that Pharaoh will pursue them, so that God can gain glory by showing His power, and so that the Egyptians will know that they are dealing with God. God manipulates Pharaoh so that Pharaoh pursues with his army on horseback and horse drawn chariots. Pharaoh and his army caught up with the Israelites. The Israelites saw the oncoming Egyptians and complained to Moses. Moses tells the Israelites not to worry because God is on their side. God tells Moses to raise his staff to the sea to part it, and to lead the Israelites across, and that God will make the Egyptians pursue them. Then God moved between the Egyptians and the Israelites, as did the pillar of cloud to keep the Egyptians away. Moses raised his staff and so God sent a East strong wind to drive the water back all night long. There was a path of dry land between two walls of water that the Israelites took to go across. The Egyptians pursued the Israelites. God confused the army and broke their chariots. After the Israelites made it across, God tells Moses to raise his hand to let the sea come back together. Moses does that and all of the Egyptian army dies in the water. The Israelites now feared God, and trusted in God and Moses.",

God rains bread (manna) from heaven each night with the instructions that for six days the Israelites will collect this manna, and on the sixth day they are to collect twice what they need, because there will be no manna the seventh day. This will repeat itself every seven days. As Aaron was telling the Israelites this, God tells Moses that He will also bring meat to the Israelites in the evening. That evening quail settled all over the camp. In the morning the ground was cover with thin, white manna that tasted like wafers made with honey. The people collected what they needed, and manna not collected, melted away. Some Israelites angered Moses by saving manna for the next day. The leftover manna was full of maggots and it stunk. On the sixth day, the people collected twice the regular manna. The seventh day the leftovers were OK. But some people still looked for manna on the seventh day.

Moses told Joshua to lead the Israelite troops. Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up on a mountain where Moses raised his hand and staff, with Aaron and Hur helping.

If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, he must make restitution. If the animal was hired, the money paid for the hire covers the loss.

The land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites that will be theirs stretches from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, and from the desert to the Euphrates.
