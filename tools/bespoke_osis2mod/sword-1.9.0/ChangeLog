	Added Module/Testament/Book/Chapter intro entries in RawDrv index
		files.  This means that YOU WILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD NEW VERSIONS

		some space so ideally the new copies are recommended).
	Added size field into .vss RawDrv index files

		an inconvenience but it saves bandwidth for download time.
		If you really feel the need to have them in your files, you
		can always resave with most nonprogramming editors and it will
		replace them, but be sure to run makeidx on 'ot' and 'nt' again
		or your index files will be off.
	Almost useful .exe in frontend/windoze/bcowl25/ (at least it shows an
		example of coding direction for use of the API)
	... probably more that I forgot ...
