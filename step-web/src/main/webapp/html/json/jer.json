"ESV_summary" : "Jeremiah, often called the \"weeping prophet\" because of his sorrow over the persistent message of God’s judgment, prophesied to the nation of Judah from the reign of King Josiah in 627 BC until sometime after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586. He dictated his prophecies to a scribe named Baruch (36:4, 32). Jeremiah’s task as a prophet was to declare the coming judgment of God. However, throughout the book we also see God’s concern for repentance and righteousness in individuals as well as nations. This dual focus is seen in God’s instructions to Jeremiah: he was \"to pluck up and to break down\" but also \"to build and to plant\" (1:10). Jeremiah sees a future day when God will write his law on human hearts, and \"they shall all know me,\" and \"I will remember their sin no more\" (31:33-34).",
"ESV_introduction" : "Jeremiah was God’s spokesman during the decline and fall of the southern kingdom, Judah. Among the Prophets not one had a more difficult task than that of standing alone for God in the midst of the apostasy of his own people, and not one who bares his soul to his reader as does Jeremiah. Although Jeremiah announced the coming destruction of Judah, he looked beyond this judgement to a day when religion, no longer national, would be individual and spiritual. This new kind of religion would result from God’s \"new covenant\" with His people.",

"chapter_1_overview" : "The LORD said to me: I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Do not be afraid. I am calling the northern kingdoms against Judah.",
"chapter_1_summary" : "Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, was a priest at Anathoth in Benjamin. He was a prophet for God from the thirteenth year of King Josiah of Judah to the fifth month of the eleventh year of King Zedekiah of Judah. God tells Jeremiah that He chose him to be a prophet from before he was conceived. Jeremiah complained that he can't speak well. God told Jeremiah to do whatever He commands and that he should not be afraid because God will protect him. God touched Jeremiah's mouth with His hand and told him that He put words into his mouth. God tells Jeremiah that he will be over nations, destroying them and building them. God asks Jeremiah what he sees. Jeremiah says that he sees an almond branch and a boiling pot tipping from the north. God says that Jeremiah sees correctly, because God is watching (which sounds like almond branch in Hebrew) to see that His word is fulfilled and the northern kingdoms will attack Judah as part of God's judgement on them for their pagan worship. God tells Jeremiah not to be terrified by people, or else God will terrify him. Instead, he is to be brave because God is with him.",

"chapter_2_overview" : "Go and proclaim: My people have exchanged their glory for idols. You have all rebelled against me. Now I will bring you to judgement.",
"chapter_2_summary" : "God remembers how the Israelites were devoted to God after they were brought out of Egypt, and how He protected them. God asks why the Israelites have now turned to idols, neglected what God has done for them, and defiled His land. Because the people now worship idols, God will punish them for generations, including their children's children. No other nation changes gods like the Israelites, who traded God for worthless idols. Not only have the Israelites forsaken God, but they have also turned to man made idols. The Egyptians have laid waste to Judah and humiliated its people. The Israelites brought this on themselves. Why do they seek protection through Egypt now? God will punish them for not respecting His power. A long time ago the Israelites stopped serving God and instead turned to idols. God started them out as a choice vine, but they have been corrupted into a wild vine. They cannot wash away their sins. God likens the Israelites relationships with pagan gods to that of a donkey in heat that is willing to take all mates. They worship idols, but then cry to God when they are in trouble. God says to let their idols save them. God has punished the Israelites in vain because they don't learn from correction and still kill the prophets. Why do the Israelites think they can neglect God? The Israelites claim to be innocent and do not think God should be angry with them. Therefore, God will make their alliance with the Egyptians fail.",
"chapter_3_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_3_overview" : "Israel played the whore on every hill. Her false sister Judah saw it. Return, O faithless children! Surely the LORD is our salvation.",
"chapter_3_summary" : "The Israelites prostitute themselves to any idols there are, and they do all the evil they can, and yet they wonder why God's wrath continues. During Josiah's reign, God said that the people of Israel turned to idols, so God divorced them. The people of Judah were influenced by Israel, and also turned to idols. When the people of Judah did return to God, it was only a superficial pretense. Jeremiah is to tell the people of Israel to return to God, acknowledge their guilt, and then God will be merciful to them. God will bring back a sparse remnant of them to Zion (Jerusalem). God will guide them with shepherds after His own heart and they will be blessed with many offspring. The Ark of the Covenant will be forgotten because Jerusalem will be God's Throne. All nations will come to Jerusalem to honor God and the Israelites will no longer be stubbornly evil. Judah and Israel will be reunited, coming back to the land from the north. God wanted to bless the Israelites, but they have been like an unfaithful wife to Him, and so they are lamented. Come back to God. Confess that they are guilty in worshiping idols and have rebelled against God.",
"chapter_4_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_4_overview" : "Flee to safety! I am bringing disaster from the north, says the LORD. I have heard the trumpet! The whole land shall be a desolation.",
"chapter_4_summary" : "The Israelites should return to God and dispose of their idols. If they righteously swear to follow God, God will bless the nations. Come back to God whole heartedly or face God's wrath. God says to tell the people of Judah to flee to the fortified city of Jerusalem because an army from the north is on its way and will lay waste to the rest of the land of Judah. In that day, the king, officials, priests, and prophets will be afraid. Jeremiah marveled at how God deceived the people of Judah by telling them they will have peace. God says that Judah will be destroyed and the people should repent to be saved. They have deserved this bitter punishment from God. They will lament its severity. The people of Judah were like foolish children which did not understand God and knew only how to do evil. In Jeremiah's vision, Judah had become a desert wasteland where even the animals had fled. God says that He will destroy Judah, but not completely. Why do the people of Judah seek protection from sources other than God? The people of Judah will be distressed like a mother birthing her first child.",
"chapter_5_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_5_overview" : "Israel and Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me. I am bringing a distant nation against you. Your sins have deprived you of good.",
"chapter_5_summary" : "God says that if there are any honest people in Jerusalem, He will forgive the city. They only superficially seek God's help. Jeremiah spoke to the people of Jerusalem and found that everybody, including the leadership, had turned from God and stubbornly refused to repent. Therefore, God will send wild animals to tear them to pieces if they leave Jerusalem. Why should God forgive them when they continually commit adultery with other gods and idols? God must punish them for this. God will destroy almost all of them for not listening and obeying Him. God will send an army from the north to destroy them, but not completely. Because they have served foreign gods, they will serve foreign men in a foreign land. The people of Judah have eyes but do not see, and have ears but do not hear. Should people not fear God, the maker of the sand which forever keeps the see from crossing it? These people turn away from God and do not respect His omnipotent power. They do limitless evil and wicked things, and will not honestly defend the fatherless or the poor, and so God will punish them. They love the way that their prophets lie to them.",
"chapter_6_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_6_overview" : "Flee from Jerusalem! I appointed watchmen but you would not listen. An army is coming from the north. My people are rejected silver.",
"chapter_6_summary" : "The people of Judah should flee to Jerusalem because God is sending and army to destroy Judah. The city of Jerusalem will be sieged to punish them because they have been wicked, and the people of Judah will be reduced to a remnant. They will not listen to God's warning. God will not have mercy on anyone because of their age. Their houses, fields, and wives will be pillaged in God's wrath. They are all greedy, deceitful, and have no shame, so God will bring them down. They do not listen to God or follow His Law. Their incense, burnt offerings, and sacrifices are not the right kind and do not please God. God will give them obstacles to make them perish, and He is sending a mighty army to destroy them. Jeremiah says that they are anguished like a woman in labor because they have heard the army is coming, and that they should repent in sackcloth and ashes. God has made Jeremiah a tester of the people, and like poor metal which cannot be refined, the people continue in their wickedness despite punishment, and so God rejects them.",
"chapter_7_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_7_overview" : "Proclaim at the temple: Has this house become a den of thieves? I sent prophets but you did not listen. Judah will become desolate.",
"chapter_7_summary" : "God tells Jeremiah to give this message at the entrance to the Temple. God tells the people that if they repent, act with justice, do not oppress foreigners, widows, or orphans, do not shed innocent blood, and do not worship other gods, then He will let them live safely in Judah. However, if they do not do these things, then God will not save them. See how God has destroyed Shiloh because the wicked people of Israel would not listen to God. God will do the same thing to Judah and the Temple. God will reject them just like he did Ephraim (the people of Israel). God will not listen to their prayers because they make offerings to the \"Queen of Heaven\" and other gods. God will pour out His wrath on man, beast, trees, and gardens. God told the Israelites to obey Him from when He took them out of Egypt, but they have not listened and they have done more evil than their forefathers. God tells Jeremiah that the people will not listen to him. Therefore, Jeremiah should tell them that God has rejected this generation. The people worship idols and sacrifice their sons and daughters in fire, something that never entered God's mind. Therefore God will make the Valley of Ben Hinnom known as the Valley of Slaughter, and it will be filled with the dead bodies of Israelites.",
"chapter_8_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_8_overview" : "Why do these people refuse to return? They have no shame. The LORD has doomed us because we have sinned. Is there no balm in Gilead?",
"chapter_8_summary" : "At that time, the bones of kings, officials, priests, and prophets of Judah will be taken out of their graves and left on the ground. The exiled surviving Israelites will prefer death to life. The people of Judah will not repent. They claim that they are wise because of God's Law, but their scribes interpret it falsely. Their wise will be shamed, and their wives and fields will be given to other men. They are all greedy and deceitful, so God will bring them down. Flee to the fortified cities, because the army is coming to destroy Judah. God has sent poisonous snakes to bite them. The people have angered God with their idol worship. The harvest has passed, and they have not been saved. Jeremiah laments that his people are crushed.",
"chapter_9_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_9_overview" : "No one speaks the truth. I will scatter these people, says the LORD. The sound of wailing is heard from Zion. I act with justice.",
"chapter_9_summary" : "Jeremiah laments his slain, exiled, and sinful people. God says that they speak lies like a bow shoots arrows. They are all deceitful. God will refine them, and punish them for their deceit. Jeremiah weeps about the destruction. God will destroy Jerusalem and Judah because they have forsaken God's Law and they worship idols. God says that they should wail for their losses in repentance. Dead bodies will be all over the place. Boast only in God, who delights in kindness, justice, and righteousness. The days are coming when God will punish the exiled Israelites because they only superficially honor God.",
"chapter_10_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_10_overview" : "Do not learn the ways of the nations. The LORD is the true God. Listen, a great commotion from the north! They have devoured Jacob.",
"chapter_10_summary" : "God tells the Israelites that they should not learn about astrology or make wooden idols adorned with metal which cannot do anything. Jeremiah says that everyone should revere God because of His wisdom and power. Unlike man-made idols, God is the true God and is omnipotent. God says that the idols did not create the earth, but God did. God controls the oceans, clouds (rising from the ends of the earth), rains, and winds. Idols cannot control anything. God is the maker of all things. God tells the people that they should be ready to go into exile. God must endure this sickness. Nobody righteously follows God. The army from the north is on its way to destroy Judah. Jeremiah says that he knows that a man's life does not belong to himself, but to God. Jeremiah prays that God deal justly, not angrily, with the Israelites, because otherwise there would be none of them left. Jeremiah suggests that instead God should pour out His wrath against the Gentile nations for destroying Judah.",
"chapter_11_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_11_overview" : "Both Israel and Judah have broken my covenant. I will bring disaster. Do not pray for them. I will punish those who seek your life.",
"chapter_11_summary" : "Since the time when God brought the Israelites out of Egypt, His covenant with them was for them to obey Him so that they could have a land flowing with milk and honey. Despite multiple warnings, the people do not obey God. God brought on all of the curses that He promised them if they did not obey, but still they did not obey. The people of Judah have conspired against God and turned to idols, so God will destroy them. They have as many gods as they do towns. God will not listen to their prayers. God once thought they were beautiful, but will now destroy them for worshiping Baal. God showed Jeremiah that he was being led to the slaughter like a gentle lamb, as the men of his hometown of Anathoth were plotting to \"cut him off from the land of the living\". Because of this, God plans to utterly destroy Anathoth, leaving no remnant in the \"year of their punishment\".",
"chapter_12_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_12_overview" : "O LORD, why do the wicked prosper? I have left my house. Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard. I will uproot my evil neighbours.",
"chapter_12_summary" : "Jeremiah says that God is always righteous, yet he asks God why He is allowing the wicked to prosper. Jeremiah prays that God will slaughter them, because it has been a long time waiting for justice. God tells Jeremiah that he will not be better off after God's judgement. Jeremiah should not trust his deceitful family. God will forsake the Israelites because they are like a lion that growls at Him, so He hates them. God will turn His Israel into a wasteland because nobody cares about Him. The army God sends will destroy the people of Judah. They people of Judah will sow wheat but will reap thorns and gain nothing, harvesting only God's anger. Sometime after the nations drag away the remnant people of Judah into exile, God will remove the nations from Israel and will bring the exiled Israelites back to Israel. If the nations learn to obey God from the Israelites, then they will be welcome in Israel. However, if they will not listen to God, God will completely destroy them.",
"chapter_13_description" : "*God will mercilessly decimate the Israelites, send the remnant into exile, and then bring them back better than before",
"chapter_13_overview" : "The LORD told me to hide a sash in the rocks. So I will ruin the pride of Judah, says the LORD. All Judah will be carried into exile.",
"chapter_13_summary" : "God has Jeremiah buy a linen belt and stuffs it in a rock crevice. Days later, God has Jeremiah get the belt, which he finds ruined and useless. God says that He will ruin the people of Judah like this belt because they worship idols and do not listen to Him. God tells Jeremiah to tell them that wineskins should be filled with wine. Then Jeremiah is to tell them that God will make everybody in Judah drunk and will have them fight one another. God will have no mercy when He destroys them. Jeremiah pleads for the people of Judah to repent, because they will be taken captive otherwise. God will shame and destroy the people of Judah because of their many sins.",
"chapter_14_description" : "*God tells Jeremiah not to pray or mourn for the Israelites because it is too late to save them from His wrath",
"chapter_14_overview" : "There is no water in the cisterns. O LORD, do not forsake us! I will destroy them by sword and by famine. Can any idols bring rain?",
"chapter_14_summary" : "God says that there is a severe drought in the land of Judah. Jeremiah prays to God, wondering why He is not saving them from this drought despite their great sins. God says that he will not save them because of their wickedness, and He tells Jeremiah not to pray for them. Jeremiah asks why the prophets say that peace will be with them. God says that they are false prophets, and God will kill so many people of Judah that there will be nobody left to bury the dead. God will weep for His \"virgin daughter\", the Israelites, during their destruction. Jeremiah prays that God will come back to them and he repents for their sins. Jeremiah says that for the sake of God's name, He should save them because He is the only one who can save them.",
"chapter_15_description" : "*God tells Jeremiah not to pray or mourn for the Israelites because it is too late to save them from His wrath",
"chapter_15_overview" : "Send these people away from my presence! Who will mourn for Jerusalem? O LORD, I suffer insult for you. I am with you, says the LORD.",
"chapter_15_summary" : "Even if Moses and Samuel pleaded for the people of Judah, God would show them no mercy. They will be killed, stuck in battle, starve, or become captives. God will send them four destroyers: the sword, dogs, birds, and beasts. The people of Judah will become despised by everyone because of what Hezekiah, the former king of Judah, did in Jerusalem. God can no longer show compassion to the people of Judah, so He will destroy them and make them have numerous widows. God will deliver Jeremiah for a good purpose. God will have Judah plundered and its people enslaved because of their sins. Jeremiah pleads with God to save him because he has faithfully and joyfully worked for God. Jeremiah asks why God is letting him suffer, and he is wondering if God will truly deliver him. God tells Jeremiah that if he repents, then God will let him be His prophet and will protect him.",

"chapter_16_overview" : "The LORD said to me: Do not marry or have children. Why has the LORD pronounced evil against us? You have followed your evil hearts.",
"chapter_16_summary" : "Then God tells Jeremiah not to marry and have children in Judah, because the people of Judah will die by disease, sword, and famine, and their bodies will be eaten by wild animals. God tells Jeremiah not to mourn for them, because God has withdrawn His blessing, love, and pity from them. God will stop the sounds of joy in Judah because the fathers of the people of Judah forsook God, worshiped other gods, and disobeyed His Law, and the present generation is even more wicked. God will remove them from Judah to a land unknown to them where they will worship other gods. However, the time will come when God will bring back the exiled Israelites to Israel. God will send people to hunt down the people of Judah. The Israelites will be punished them double for their sin because they have defiled Israel, God's land. God will teach all the nations that He is God.",

"chapter_17_summary" : "The people of Judah's sin comes from deep within them and their sinful practices get passed down to their children. God will let the nation of Judah be destroyed and its people will be enslaved, because made God angry and His anger will last forever. Cursed is the man who trusts man, but blessed is the man who trusts God. God studies the heart and mind of a man and rewards him according to what he deserves. Those which forsake God will be shamed and destroyed. Jeremiah prays that God will shame and destroy his enemies and shelter him from the upcoming destruction. God tells Jeremiah to stand at the gates of Jerusalem and proclaim that if the people of Judah keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it, then Jerusalem will be inhabited forever. Otherwise, God will destroy Jerusalem.",

"chapter_18_summary" : "God is like a potter and Israel is like the clay. If God says that He will destroy a nation but they then repent of their sins, then God will not destroy them. If God says that He will bless a nation but they then do evil, then He will reconsider the blessing He had intended for them. God says that He is planning to destroy Judah, so the people should repent of their sins, but they will choose to continue being evil. Because Virgin Israel has turned to idol worship, God will turn Israel into a wasteland. The people plotted to kill Jeremiah because they thought he was worthless. Jeremiah prays that God will punish his enemies.",

"chapter_19_overview" : "The LORD said: Buy a clay jar. These people have burned sacrifices to foreign gods. Then break the jar. So I will smash this nation.",
"chapter_19_summary" : "God tells Jeremiah to take a clay jar near the Potsherd Gate and tell the people that God will bring such destruction on Jerusalem that the ears of the people which hear about its destruction will tingle. This is because they worship other gods, killed the innocent, and even went so far as to sacrifice their sons in the fire to Baal, something which God never commanded or thought of requiring. Therefore, the Valley of Ben Hinnom will become known as the Valley of Slaughter. Judah and Jerusalem will be ruined and their people will be killed and left for wild animals to eat. During the siege of Jerusalem, they will resort to cannibalism. Then Jeremiah is to smash the jar and say that God will smash the city and the nation like the jar. Topheth will become so full of the dead that they will not be able to bury anyone else there. This is because they worshiped other gods. Jeremiah then went to the Temple and said that God said He would destroy Jerusalem and its surrounding villages because they would not listen to Him.",

The next day Pashhur released Jeremiah, and Jeremiah told Pashhur that God says that He will make Pashhur a terror because God will orchestrate the killing of his friends in front of him. Judah will be completely captured by the Babylonians, and Pashhur will be taken to Babylon in exile where he and his friends will die and be buried. Jeremiah laments that God controls him and forces him to speak God's word, which only makes him become scorned and mocked. Even his friends wait to take revenge on him. However, God protects Jeremiah from being completely prevailed against. Jeremiah prays to see God's vengeance on those which would harm him. God rescues the needy from the wicked. Jeremiah curses the day that he was born and curses the man who told Jeremiah's father that Jeremiah was born, asking God to show that man no pity because he did not instead kill Jeremiah in the womb.

Those which do not die by plague, sword, or famine will be captured by Nebuchadnezzar, who will kill them and show no mercy. God says that He is giving the people the choice; the way of life or the way of death. If they surrender, they will live. If they instead fight, they will die because God will destroy Jerusalem.

Do not shed innocent blood. If they do this, they will keep the city of Jerusalem. Otherwise, God will ruin it. Although God once prized the land of Judah, He will turn it into a desolate desert because they have forsaken Him. Do not weep for the king, but instead weep for the exiled people who will never see the land of Judah again. Shallum, the King of Judah, will never return to Judah. Shallum built himself a big palace with slave labor and sought dishonest gain, unlike his righteous father Josiah. Josiah's son Jehoiakim will have his dead body dragged out of Jerusalem because he disobeyed God from the beginning. He will be shamed with a painful end.

People will then swear by the God that brought the exiled Israelites back to Israel. Jeremiah laments the wicked prophets that Judah has. God says that their prophets and priests are godless and wicked, so He will punish them for leading the people astray and being wicked. The prophets are lying and have not been given messages from God because they did not seek God's guidance. God sees and knows everything. The deluded prophets speak about dreams to guide the people away from God. The prophet with God's word will speak it faithfully with power. God is angry with the false prophets.

God says that king Zedekiah, his officials, and the survivors of Jerusalem will be like the bad figs; wherever they are God will curse them to a life of reproach and ridicule, and any which stay in the land of Israel will be completely destroyed.

Therefore, God will summon the people of the north and His servant Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Judah and all of the surrounding nations giving them everlasting ruin. Judah will be desolate, and all of these nations will serve Babylon for 70 years. Then, God will punish the land of Babylon by making it desolate forever. At that time God will bring about all that He spoke against all nations; what is written in this book and spoken by Jeremiah. The Babylonians will be enslaved by many nations for what they have done. (Cross-reference 2 Chronicles 36) God gave Jeremiah a cup of the wine of God's wrath and instructed him to give to the nations where God sent him, which included \"all the kingdoms on the face of the earth\". The king of Babylon is to drink it after everyone else. If anyone refuses to drink it, Jeremiah is to tell them that God says that they must drink it, because if God is punishing His people then He will surely punish everyone else too. God will bring judgement on all of mankind and will kill the wicked by the sword. Those killed by God will be littering the ground all over the earth.

"chapter_26_summary" : "Early in Jehoiakim's reign, God told Jeremiah to give a prophesy in the courtyard of the Temple and so that maybe the Israelites would listen to God so that He would not have to destroy them as He was planning to do. The prophesy is that if the people do not listen to God and obey His Law, then God will destroy Jerusalem like Shiloh was destroyed. The priests and prophets seized Jeremiah and threatened to kill him after he gave the prophesy. Jeremiah said that God gave him the prophesy and if they do not listen to God then God will destroy them, and they can do whatever they think is right to him. The officials said that Jeremiah should not be killed because he gave a prophesy from God. The elders said that Micah of Moresheth prophesied when Hezekiah was king that Zion (Judah) would be destroyed. The elders pointed out that because Hezekiah then repented, God did not bring that disaster on them. Therefore, if they do not listen to God they will be destroyed. Uriah, the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim had earlier prophesied the same thing as Jeremiah, so king Jehoiakim tried to kill Uriah.

Jeremiah tells him that Jeremiah's cousin Hanamel will tell Jeremiah to buy a field in Anathoth for him. Then Hanamel came in and did just that. Jeremiah bought the field for 17 shekels of silver. Jeremiah tells them to seal the deed in a clay jar, because God says in the future the Israelites will be back in this land. Jeremiah prayed to God, saying that God made everything, nothing is too hard for Him, He loves thousands but punishes children for their fathers' sins, He is mighty, He rewards everyone according to their conduct, He performs signs and wonders to this day, and He brought the Israelites out of Egypt with great terror and into the Promised Land, but the Israelites have not listened to Him, so God brought this destruction to them. Just like God said would happen, Jerusalem is being destroyed by sword, famine, and plague. Jeremiah has bought the field per God's instructions. God then told Jeremiah: Nothing is too hard for God. Jerusalem will be taken and destroyed where they worshiped other gods by the Babylonians. The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil since their youth. Jerusalem transgressed God since it was built and so God will destroy it. The people of Judah have worshiped idols and other gods, and sacrificed their sons and daughters to Molech. God is destroying Jerusalem, but in the future He will gather them back from the lands where He had banished them and let them live in safety. He will be their God, and will give them a focus on God so that they will always fear Him for their own good and for their children after them. This will be an everlasting covenant, and God will always do good for them and inspire fear in them so that they will not turn away from Him.

God will forgive all of their sins. All of the other nations will be in awe and fear of Jerusalem because of the renown, joy, praise, honor, prosperity, and peace it experiences due to God. Although Judah will become desolate, God will restore it to its former glory and people will make thank offerings to God there. The days are coming when God will keep His promise to Israel and Judah and will make a righteous branch of the Davidic lineage rule in Jerusalem. In those days Judah will be saved and will be safe. It/He will be called \"the LORD Our Righteousness\". From then on, there will forever be a king of Davidic lineage ruling and the Levites will forever offer burnt offerings, burnt grain offerings, and sacrifices.

Recently they repented and freed the Hebrew slaves, but then changed their minds. Because they have done this sin, God will \"free\" them to be killed by sword, plague, and famine.

They sent Jehudi to bring Baruch and the scroll to them, and then had Baruch read it to them. The officials tell Baruch and Jeremiah to hide, and then eventually have the scroll read to the king by Jehudi. King Jehoiakim burnt parts of the scroll after it was read until the entire scroll was burnt. None of the royalty showed fear or tore their clothes. The king tried to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah, but they could not be found because God had hidden them. God told Jeremiah to write another scroll just like the first, but to add on that God would severely punish Jehoiakim, his children, and attendants for what he did, and he would not have a descendant on the throne of David.
