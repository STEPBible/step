"book_overview" : "The kings of Judah from Solomon to the Exile and destruction of the Temple",
"ESV_summary" : "Second Chronicles, which extends 1 Chronicles’ history of Judah, was written sometime after the people began to return from the Babylonian exile in 538 BC (36:23). The \"chronicler,\" perhaps trying to encourage the returned exiles, recalls the greatness of Solomon’s reign. Most of the book, however, focuses on Judah’s fall into sin which had led to the exile. Judah had several godly kings, especially Hezekiah and Josiah, but it still declined into sin. Still, God remained faithful to his covenant people, and as the book closes it jumps ahead several years, recording the decree of Cyrus that allowed the Jewish exiles to return to their Promised Land. The author is unknown, although many have thought that Ezra was the principal writer.",
"ESV_introduction" : "In the Hebrew Canon these books formed a single volume called \"Things of the days\" (i.e., annals). The translators of the Greek Septuagint Version gave them the title, Paraleipomena, meaning \"things left over\", implying their use as a supplement to Samuel and Kings. Jerome (c. A.D. 340-420) called them \"a chronicle of the whole and sacred history\" from Adam to Cyrus (538 B.C.), hence their English name. Actually, Chronicles is a summary of Hebrew history that duplicates much of Samuel and Kings.",
