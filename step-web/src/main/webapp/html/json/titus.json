"ESV_summary" : "This pastoral letter from Paul to Titus was intended to offer encouragement and wisdom as Titus endured ongoing opposition from the ungodly and from legalists within his congregations. Paul instructed Titus to complete his assigned job of establishing overseers (elders) for the churches under his care. He described what sort of people these leaders should be, and how all believers should live in relation to each other as well as in their interactions with nonbelievers. Proper Christian behavior is based on the fact that \"the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,\" and therefore those who believe in Christ are to \"live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives\" as they await his return (2:11-13). Paul probably wrote this letter in the 60s AD",
"ESV_introduction" : "This is a personal letter written by the Apostle Paul to a young minister whom he had left on Crete. Like the Timothy correspondence, the letter to Titus is practical and discusses the everyday problems confronted by a young minister. This letter is probably to be dated between the first and the second letters to Timothy.",
