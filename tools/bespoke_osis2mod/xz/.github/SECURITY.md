# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates to the development branch and the stable
branches. Security patches for old releases are available on the
[project website](https://tukaani.org/xz).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please
report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives
us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing
the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

You may submit a report by emailing us at
[xz@tukaani.org](mailto:xz@tukaani.org), or through
[Security Advisories](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/security/advisories/new).
While both options are available, we prefer email. In any case, please
provide a clear description of the vulnerability including:

- Affected versions of XZ Utils
- Estimated severity (low, moderate, high, critical)
- Steps to recreate the vulnerability
- All relevant files (core dumps, build logs, input files, etc.)

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort
basis. As such, please give us 90 days to work on a fix before
public exposure.
