Could I not wash in them and be clean?\" The Abana was apparently a significant and highly regarded river near Damascus. Naaman considered it superior to the Jordan River of Israel. After his servants reasoned with him, Naaman relented and washed in the Jordan as instructed, and his leprosy was cured. The Abana River is generally identified with the modern Barada River, the primary river that flows through Damascus.",

It was there that he was brought before the judgment seat of Gallio, the proconsul of Achaia (Acts 18:12). Later, Apollos visited Achaia and ministered in Corinth (Acts 18:27-19:1). ¶Paul wrote several epistles to churches in Achaia, including 1 and 2 Corinthians, addressed to the church in Corinth, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians to the church in Thessalonica, the capital of neighboring Macedonia. In his epistles, Paul commended the generosity of the churches of Achaia in giving to the collection for the believers in Jerusalem (Romans 15:26, 2 Corinthians 9:2) and noted their role in spreading the gospel (1 Thessalonians 1:7-8). ¶The churches in Achaia faced significant challenges, including divisions, immorality, and false teachings, as addressed in Paul's epistles to them. Nevertheless, Achaia remained an important center of early Christianity, producing influential leaders such as Stephanas (1 Corinthians 16:15) and Phoebe (Romans 16:1).",

The Valley of Achor is also mentioned as a boundary marker for the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:7). ¶In later prophetic writings, the Valley of Achor is used symbolically. Isaiah 65:10 portrays it as a place of rest and abundance for God's people in the future messianic age. Hosea 2:15 describes it as a place of hope and restoration, where God will turn Israel's sorrow into joy, comparing it to a \"door of hope.\" These passages suggest that the Valley of Achor, once a place of judgment and trouble, will become a symbol of God's blessing and redemption for His people.",

As a coastal settlement, Achzib was likely involved in maritime trade and commerce.

As a result, Admah and the other cities were defeated and plundered by Chedorlaomer's coalition. ¶Later, Admah was destroyed by God along with Sodom and Gomorrah because of their wickedness (Deuteronomy 29:23). The destruction of these cities is held up as an example of God's judgment against sin. The prophet Hosea also refers to Admah and Zeboiim as a warning to Israel, emphasizing the severity of God's potential judgment (Hosea 11:8). The exact location of Admah is unknown, as the cities of the plain were completely destroyed, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the Dead Sea basin.",

The ship likely followed a common trade route, stopping at various ports to unload and load cargo and passengers. ¶Adramyttium was located in the region of Mysia, near the island of Lesbos. It was an important port city in the Roman province of Asia and a center for trade and commerce. The city was known for its shipbuilding industry and its strategic location along the Aegean coast. Apart from its mention in Paul's journey, Adramyttium does not play any other significant role in the biblical narrative. Its inclusion in Acts 27 provides a glimpse into the maritime travel and trade networks of the Roman Empire in the first century AD.",

On the fourteenth night of the storm, the sailors sensed they were approaching land and took soundings, fearing they might run aground on the rocks. ¶In the context of Acts 27, the term \"Adriatic Sea\" likely refers to a broader area that includes not only the modern Adriatic Sea between Italy and Croatia but also the central Mediterranean Sea south of Greece and west of Crete. This understanding is based on the usage of the term in ancient sources and the probable route of Paul's ship. ¶The storm that Paul's ship encountered was likely a Euraquilo, a strong northeasterly wind that blows in the Mediterranean during the winter months. The ship was eventually wrecked on the island of Malta (Acts 28:1), where Paul and the other survivors were welcomed by the islanders and spent three months before continuing their journey to Rome. The mention of the Adriatic Sea in Acts 27 highlights the dangers and challenges of maritime travel in the ancient world and provides a vivid backdrop for Paul's perilous journey to stand trial before Caesar.",

King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, fortified Adullam as part of his defensive strategy (2 Chronicles 11:7). After the Babylonian exile, Adullam was among the towns resettled by the people of Judah (Nehemiah 11:30). ¶The prophet Micah used Adullam as a symbol of the degradation and shame that would come upon the nobles of Israel because of their sins (Micah 1:15). In the story of Judah and Tamar, Judah was associated with the town of Adullam, where his friend Hirah lived (Genesis 38:1,12,20).

Its location is generally identified with Tal'at ed-Damm, a steep ascent on the modern Jericho-Jerusalem road, approximately halfway between the two cities. The pass of Adummim was known for its treacherous terrain and its association with robbers, as alluded to in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37).",

The mention of Aenon in the context of John's ministry highlights the importance of baptism and the need for adequate water resources to perform this ritual. Some scholars also see the reference to Aenon as an indication of John's growing influence and the expanding scope of his ministry beyond the immediate region of the Jordan River.",

After the fast, the exiles set out from Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month and arrived safely in Jerusalem, thanks to the hand of God upon them (Ezra 8:31).

The continued presence of Canaanites in cities like Ahlab would have exposed the Israelites to the influence of pagan religions and practices, which ultimately led to spiritual decline and disobedience to God.

However, the Israelites were initially defeated because of Achan's sin (Joshua 7:4-5). ¶After dealing with Achan, Joshua set an ambush and conquered Ai, killing its inhabitants and burning the city (Joshua 8). The king of Ai was hanged, and a heap of stones was raised over his body (Joshua 8:29). The conquest of Ai opened the way for the Israelites to advance into the heart of Canaan (Joshua 9:3; 10:1-2). Ai is listed among the cities defeated by Joshua (Joshua 12:9). ¶After the Babylonian exile, some people from Ai returned to Jerusalem (Ezra 2:28; Nehemiah 7:32). Ai was resettled by the Benjamites (Nehemiah 11:31). The city is also mentioned in Isaiah 10:28 as part of a prophetic description of the Assyrian invasion of Judah.

The Ammonites are called to lament and run to and fro, for their god Milcom will go into exile along with his priests and officials. This prophecy was likely fulfilled during the Babylonian conquest of the region under Nebuchadnezzar II in the early 6th century BC. The exact location of this Ammonite city of Ai is unknown.",

Elon, a judge of Israel, was buried in Aijalon (Judges 12:12). During Saul's reign, the Israelites pursued the Philistines as far as Aijalon (1 Samuel 14:31). Some descendants of Benjamin, including the family of Beriah, lived in Aijalon (1 Chronicles 8:13). ¶King Rehoboam of Judah fortified Aijalon as part of his defensive strategy (2 Chronicles 11:10). Later, during the reign of King Ahaz, the Philistines captured Aijalon and settled there (2 Chronicles 28:18). The city is generally identified with the modern village of Yalo, about 13 miles (21 km) northwest of Jerusalem.",

It is also known as the Potter's Field. ¶According to Matthew's account, when Judas realized the consequences of his betrayal, he returned the money to the chief priests and elders. However, they considered it unlawful to put the money into the temple treasury, as it was \"blood money.\" Instead, they used the money to purchase a potter's field as a burial place for foreigners (Matthew 27:7). ¶In Acts, the field is called Akeldama, and it is stated that Judas bought the field with the reward of his wickedness and fell headlong there, bursting open in the middle, and his intestines gushed out (Acts 1:18). The field was then known as the Field of Blood because of its association with Judas' death and the blood money used to purchase it. ¶The location of Akeldama is traditionally identified as a site south of Jerusalem, near the junction of the Hinnom and Kidron Valleys. The area has been used as a burial ground for centuries, with numerous tombs and burial caves dating from ancient times to the present day. ¶The purchase of Akeldama with the money from Judas' betrayal is seen as a fulfillment of prophecy, as stated in Matthew 27:9-10, which quotes from Zechariah 11:12-13 and Jeremiah 32:6-9. The field serves as a reminder of the tragic consequences of Judas' betrayal and the ultimate redemption brought about by Jesus' sacrifice.",

They inhabited the desert regions of the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev. The Amalekites were the first nation to attack Israel after the Exodus, at Rephidim (Exodus 17:8-16). Moses, with the help of Aaron and Hur, interceded for Israel while Joshua led the army in battle. As a result, God declared that He would be at war with Amalek from generation to generation (Exodus 17:16). ¶The Amalekites, along with other enemies, continued to harass Israel during the period of the judges (Judges 3:13; 6:3,33; 7:12; 10:12). Saul, Israel's first king, was commanded to completely destroy the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:2-3). However, he disobeyed by sparing their king, Agag, and some of the livestock (1 Samuel 15:7-9). This act of disobedience led to God's rejection of Saul as king (1 Samuel 15:23; 28:18). ¶During David's reign, the Amalekites were among the enemies he defeated (1 Samuel 30:1-20; 2 Samuel 8:12; 1 Chronicles 18:11). The last mention of the Amalekites is in 1 Chronicles 4:43, which records that some of the Simeonites destroyed the remnant of the Amalekites during the time of Hezekiah. ¶The Amalekites are also mentioned in prophetic and poetic texts as symbols of Israel's enemies (Numbers 24:20; Psalm 83:7). Their persistent opposition to Israel and their role in the narratives of Saul and David make them significant adversaries in the biblical history of Israel.",

The hill of Ammah may have been a prominent landmark or a strategic vantage point in the area. ¶Apart from this single mention in the narrative of the conflict between David's and Saul's forces, no other information about Ammah is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the text serves to provide a geographical reference point for the pursuit and to emphasize the distance covered by Joab and Abishai in their attempt to capture Abner.",

    "longDescription": "Ammon was an ancient nation located east of the Jordan River, in the region known as the Transjordan. The Ammonites were descendants of Ben-ammi, the son of Lot by his younger daughter (Genesis 19:38). They inhabited the area north of Moab and east of the tribe of Reuben. ¶Throughout history, the Ammonites were often in conflict with Israel. During the time of the judges, the Ammonites oppressed Israel (Judges 10:6-9) until Jephthah defeated them (Judges 11). Saul fought against the Ammonites and rescued Jabesh-gilead from their siege (1 Samuel 11:1-11). David, during his reign, also engaged in battles with the Ammonites (2 Samuel 10; 12:26-31). ¶The Ammonite capital city was Rabbah (also known as Rabbath-Ammon), which was besieged and captured by Joab, David's commander (2 Samuel 12:26-29). The city later became part of the Ammonite territory again. The Ammonites were known for their worship of the god Milcom (1 Kings 11:5,33; 2 Kings 23:13). ¶The prophets often spoke against Ammon for their hostility towards Israel and predicted their downfall (Jeremiah 49:1-6; Ezekiel 21:28-32; 25:1-7)",

Amphipolis was originally an Athenian colony but later came under Macedonian and then Roman control. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any details about Paul's activities in Amphipolis, the mention of the city in the context of his journey highlights the strategic importance of the Via Egnatia for the spread of the gospel in the region. The inclusion of Amphipolis in the itinerary demonstrates Paul's intentional efforts to reach major cities and transportation hubs with the message of Christ.",

It was assigned to the Levites, specifically the descendants of Aaron, as one of their cities (Joshua 21:18; 1 Chronicles 6:60). ¶The city is most notably associated with the prophet Jeremiah, who was born in Anathoth (Jeremiah 1:1). Jeremiah faced opposition from the people of his hometown, who plotted against his life because of his prophecies (Jeremiah 11:21-23). The prophet also received a divine command to purchase a field in Anathoth, which served as a sign of the future restoration of Judah (Jeremiah 32:7-9). ¶Several prominent figures in the Bible were associated with Anathoth, including Abiathar, a priest during the reign of King Solomon, who was exiled to Anathoth after supporting Adonijah's claim to the throne (1 Kings 2:26). Two of David's mighty men, Abiezer and Jehu, were also from Anathoth (2 Samuel 23:27; 1 Chronicles 11:28; 12:3; 27:12). ¶Anathoth was among the towns resettled by the Benjamites after the Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:23; Nehemiah 7:27; 11:32). The city is also mentioned in a prophetic context, as Isaiah declares judgment upon it (Isaiah 10:30), and Jeremiah confronts a false prophet from Anathoth named Pashhur (Jeremiah 29:27). ¶The biblical references to Anathoth highlight its significance as a Levitical city, its connection to the life and ministry of Jeremiah, and its role in the history of Israel, particularly during the divided monarchy and the post-exilic period.",

By building towers at key locations, Uzziah aimed to improve the city's security and protect it from potential enemy attacks. ¶Apart from this single mention in the context of Uzziah's building activities, no other information about the Angle is provided in the Bible.

After the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, the land was divided among the tribes of Israel. The listing of cities and towns, including Anim, demonstrates the systematic distribution of the land and the establishment of Judah's presence in the region. ¶Apart from its mention in the list of Judah's cities, no other information about Anim is provided in the Bible.

After the persecution that followed Stephen's martyrdom, some believers from Cyprus and Cyrene came to Antioch and preached the gospel to the Hellenists (Greeks) there (Acts 11:19-20). The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch, who encouraged the believers and brought Saul (Paul) there to teach (Acts 11:22-26). ¶It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians (Acts 11:26). The city became a hub for missionary activity, with Paul and Barnabas being sent out from Antioch on their first missionary journey (Acts 13:1-3; 14:26). The church in Antioch also played a crucial role in the Jerusalem Council, which addressed the issue of Gentile believers and the Mosaic Law (Acts 15:1-35). ¶Antioch was the home church of several notable figures, including the prophet Agabus (Acts 11:27-28) and the evangelist Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch (Acts 6:5). The apostle Peter visited Antioch, where Paul confronted him about his inconsistent behavior regarding Gentile believers (Galatians 2:11-14). ¶The church in Antioch became a model of a multicultural, mission-oriented congregation, demonstrating the power of the gospel to transcend cultural barriers and unite believers in Christ. Its strategic location and the fervor of its believers made Antioch a launching pad for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.",

It is mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's missionary journeys. During Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas visited Antioch in Pisidia, where Paul preached in the synagogue on the Sabbath (Acts 13:14-41). ¶Paul's message in the synagogue focused on Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and the offer of forgiveness of sins through faith in Him. While some of the Jews and proselytes believed, others rejected the message and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, forcing them to leave the city (Acts 13:42-52). ¶Later, on their return journey, Paul and Barnabas revisited Antioch in Pisidia, strengthening the disciples and appointing elders in the church (Acts 14:21-23). However, the city continued to be a place of opposition, as Jews from Antioch and Iconium followed Paul and Barnabas to Lystra, where they stoned Paul and left him for dead (Acts 14:19-20). ¶In his second letter to Timothy, Paul mentions the persecutions and sufferings he endured in Antioch, along with Iconium and Lystra, highlighting the challenges he faced while preaching the gospel in these cities (2 Timothy 3:11). ¶The events in Antioch in Pisidia demonstrate the mixed response to the gospel message, with some embracing it and others violently opposing it. Despite the difficulties, the church in Antioch in Pisidia was established and strengthened through Paul's ministry.",

After a plot against Paul's life was uncovered, the Roman commander ordered soldiers to escort Paul to Antipatris by night, ensuring his safety. ¶The city of Antipatris was built by Herod the Great and named after his father, Antipater. It was situated in a strategic location along the major road connecting Jerusalem to Caesarea, the Roman capital of Judea. The soldiers brought Paul to Antipatris, where they likely rested before continuing the journey to Caesarea the following day. ¶The mention of Antipatris in the account of Paul's transfer highlights the Roman authorities' concern for his safety and their efforts to protect him from the Jewish conspirators who sought to kill him. The city served as a stopover point on the journey, allowing the soldiers to cover a significant distance from Jerusalem and ensuring Paul's secure arrival in Caesarea. ¶Apart from this single reference in the context of Paul's transfer, no other information about Antipatris is provided in the Bible.

Despite the vast Aramean army, the Israelites, guided by a prophet, achieved a decisive victory. The Arameans fled to Aphek, where a wall collapsed and killed many of them (1 Kings 20:26-30). ¶Later, during the reign of Jehoash, Aphek is mentioned again in the context of the Aramean oppression of Israel. The prophet Elisha, on his deathbed, instructed King Jehoash to shoot an arrow from the window, symbolizing the Lord's arrow of victory over the Arameans at Aphek (2 Kings 13:17). ¶The precise location of this Aphek is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Fiq, a site in the eastern part of the Jezreel Valley, near the modern-day town of Kibbutz Afik.

It is mentioned in Joshua 12:18 as one of the cities defeated by Joshua during the conquest of Canaan. Later, Aphek was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:53). ¶The city is most notably associated with the conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. In 1 Samuel 4:1, the Israelites camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek. The Philistines defeated the Israelites in battle and captured the Ark of the Covenant. Years later, during the reign of King Saul, the Philistines gathered their forces at Aphek before the fateful battle at Mount Gilboa, where Saul and his sons were killed (1 Samuel 29:1). ¶The exact location of Aphek in the Shephelah is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Tel Aphek, a site near the Yarkon River, about 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Joppa. The city's strategic location along the coastal plain made it a significant military stronghold and a focal point of the ongoing struggles between Israel and the Philistines.",

It simply states that they passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia before arriving in Thessalonica. This suggests that Apollonia was a transit point along the route, and Paul's primary focus was on reaching Thessalonica, where he spent significant time preaching and establishing a church. ¶Apollonia was situated about 30 miles (48 km) southwest of Amphipolis and about 37 miles (60 km) northeast of Thessalonica. The city was named after the Greek god Apollo and was known for its strategic location and commercial importance. ¶The mention of Apollonia in the context of Paul's journey highlights the apostle's systematic approach to evangelizing major cities and his use of the well-established Roman road system to facilitate his travel and the spread of the gospel.",

God instructed them not to harass or provoke the Moabites, as He had given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession (Deuteronomy 2:9). The Israelites bypassed Ar and continued their journey (Deuteronomy 2:18). ¶In Numbers 21, the Israelites' journey is described, mentioning the valleys that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab (Numbers 21:15). Later in the chapter, a poetic passage refers to a fire that came out of Heshbon and consumed Ar of Moab (Numbers 21:28), likely alluding to a past military conquest. ¶The prophet Isaiah also mentions Ar in his prophecy against Moab, declaring that Ar is laid waste and destroyed in a night (Isaiah 15:1). This prophecy foretells the coming judgment on Moab and its capital city. ¶The exact location of Ar is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the modern city of Rabba, about 15 miles (24 km) south of the Arnon River. As the capital of Moab, Ar would have been a significant political and economic center in the region.",

The listing of cities and towns, including Arab, demonstrates the systematic distribution of the land and the establishment of Judah's presence in the region. ¶Apart from its mention in the list of Judah's cities, no other information about Arab is provided in the Bible.

The Arabah is described as part of the route they took and as a region they passed through. ¶The Arabah is also mentioned in the book of Joshua as a reference point for the boundaries of the tribal allotments (Joshua 11:16; 12:1, 3, 8; 18:18). It served as a natural border between the territories of the tribes settling in Canaan. ¶In the historical books, the Arabah is associated with events such as David's flight from Absalom (2 Samuel 2:29; 4:7) and the escape of King Zedekiah from Jerusalem during the Babylonian invasion (2 Kings 25:4; Jeremiah 39:4; 52:7). ¶The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel mention the Arabah in their prophecies. Isaiah speaks of the Arabah as a place of desolation (Isaiah 33:9), while Ezekiel envisions a future restoration where the waters flowing from the temple will bring life to the Arabah (Ezekiel 47:8). ¶The Arabah's arid climate and sparse vegetation make it a challenging environment. However, its strategic location along trade routes and its unique geological features, such as the Dead Sea, have made it a significant region throughout biblical history.",

In the Bible, Arabia and its inhabitants, the Arabs or Arbites, are mentioned in various contexts, ranging from commercial interactions to prophetic messages. ¶The Queen of Sheba, who visited King Solomon, is said to have brought gifts from Arabia, including gold, spices, and precious stones (1 Kings 10:15; 2 Chronicles 9:14). The Arabians also paid tribute to King Jehoshaphat of Judah (2 Chronicles 17:11) and were among the enemies who attacked Judah during the reigns of Jehoram and Ahaziah (2 Chronicles 21:16; 22:1). ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel mention Arabia and its inhabitants in their prophecies. Isaiah delivers a message concerning Arabia, foretelling the decline of its glory (Isaiah 21:13-17). Jeremiah includes the kings of Arabia among those who will drink the cup of God's wrath (Jeremiah 25:24). Ezekiel lists Arabia as one of the nations that traded with Tyre (Ezekiel 27:21) and includes the Arabians among the allies of Egypt who will fall (Ezekiel 30:5). ¶In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul mentions his visit to Arabia after his conversion (Galatians 1:17) and uses Mount Sinai in Arabia as an allegory for the earthly Jerusalem (Galatians 4:25). On the day of Pentecost, Arabs were among the people who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:11). ¶The Arabians were known for their nomadic lifestyle, traveling through the desert with their herds and engaging in trade. They were skilled in archery and horsemanship, making them formidable opponents in warfare. ¶Throughout the Bible, Arabia and its people are portrayed as having both positive and negative interactions with Israel and the surrounding nations, reflecting the complex dynamics of the ancient Near East.",

Zobah was an Aramean kingdom located in central Syria, north of Damascus. The Arameans of Zobah were among the enemies Israel faced during the time of the united monarchy. ¶The title of the psalm suggests that David engaged in a military campaign against Aram-zobah, likely seeking to expand Israel's influence and control in the region. The conflict with Aram-zobah is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 8:3-8 and 1 Chronicles 18:3-8, which describe David's victories over Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, and his allies. ¶David's success against Aram-zobah and the acquisition of valuable resources, such as gold, silver, and bronze, contributed to the strengthening of Israel's position and wealth during his reign. The mention of Aram-zobah in the psalm title serves as a reminder of David's military prowess and the challenges he faced in establishing Israel's dominance in the region.",

    "longDescription": "Ararat is a mountain range located in the region of Armenia, in present-day eastern Turkey. It is most famously known as the place where Noah's ark came to rest after the great flood, as recorded in Genesis 8:4. The specific mountain is often identified as Mount Ararat, which consists of two peaks: Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat. ¶In the Bible, Ararat is also mentioned in the context of historical events. In 2 Kings 19:37 and Isaiah 37:38, it is recorded that Adrammelech and Sharezer, the sons of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, fled to the land of Ararat after assassinating their father. This suggests that Ararat was a recognized geographical and political entity during the time of the Assyrian Empire. ¶Furthermore, in Jeremiah 51:27, Ararat is mentioned alongside Minni and Ashkenaz as kingdoms summoned to rise up against Babylon. This prophetic passage foretells the fall of Babylon and the role that the kingdoms of Ararat and its allies would play in this event. ¶The biblical references to Ararat highlight its significance as a geographical landmark and its association with important events in biblical history, most notably the landing of Noah's ark and the preservation of life after the flood. The mention of Ararat in the context of political alliances and conflicts also demonstrates its relevance in the geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East.",

    "longDescription": "The Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill, was a prominent hill located in the city of Athens, Greece. It served as a meeting place for the Athenian council, which was responsible for judicial and legislative matters in the city. The Areopagus is most notably mentioned in Acts 17 in connection with the Apostle Paul's visit to Athens during his second missionary journey. ¶According to Acts 17:19, some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered Paul and brought him to the Areopagus to inquire about his teachings. They were intrigued by Paul's message about Jesus and the resurrection, which they considered to be foreign concepts. ¶Standing in the midst of the Areopagus, Paul delivered a powerful speech, addressing the religious and philosophical beliefs of the Athenians (Acts 17:22-31). He observed that the city was full of idols and even found an altar dedicated to an \"unknown god.\" Paul used this as a starting point to proclaim the one true God, the Creator of all things, who is not confined to man-made temples or idols. ¶Paul's message at the Areopagus emphasized the sovereignty of God, the need for repentance, and the reality of the resurrection and coming judgment through Jesus Christ. While some mocked Paul's message, others believed, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus council, and a woman named Damaris (Acts 17:34). ¶The account of Paul's preaching at the Areopagus demonstrates his ability to engage with the intellectual and philosophical currents of his time, adapting his message to the audience while remaining faithful to the core truths of the gospel. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities the early church faced in proclaiming the message of Christ in a diverse and pluralistic society.",

These cities were noted for their high walls, gates, and bars, indicating their strong defensive capabilities (Deuteronomy 3:5). ¶The region of Argob was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 3:13). Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took possession of Argob and named it Havvoth-jair, which means \"the towns of Jair\" (Deuteronomy 3:14). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Argob was included in the territory governed by one of his twelve officers, who was responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household (1 Kings 4:13). ¶The biblical references to Argob highlight its significance as a fortified and strategically important region in the Transjordan area. The conquest of Argob by the Israelites demonstrates their military success under divine guidance and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land. The region's inclusion in the allotment of the tribes and its mention during Solomon's reign underscore its ongoing importance in the history of Israel.",

It is mentioned numerous times in the Old Testament, primarily in the context of Israel's journey to the Promised Land and the subsequent division of the territory. ¶During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, the Arnon served as a boundary between the Moabites and the Amorites (Numbers 21:13). The Amorites, led by King Sihon, had previously conquered the land north of the Arnon from the Moabites (Numbers 21:26). When the Israelites requested passage through Sihon's territory, he refused and engaged them in battle. Israel defeated Sihon and took possession of the land from the Arnon to the Jabbok (Numbers 21:24). ¶The Arnon later served as the southern border of the territory assigned to the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Deuteronomy 3:12, 16; Joshua 13:9, 16). It also marked the southern limit of the region controlled by King Sihon (Deuteronomy 2:36; Joshua 12:2) and, in later years, the extent of Jephthah's victories over the Ammonites (Judges 11:18, 22). ¶During the reign of Jehu, king of Israel, the territory east of the Jordan, including the area from the Arnon, was lost to Hazael, king of Aram (2 Kings 10:33). The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah also mention the Arnon in their prophecies concerning Moab (Isaiah 16:2; Jeremiah 48:20). ¶The Arnon's significance in the Bible lies in its role as a geographical boundary, marking the limits of territorial control for various nations and tribes throughout Israel's history. Its frequent mention in the context of military campaigns and territorial allotments underscores its importance as a strategic landmark in the region.",

David's act of sharing the spoils with Aroer and other cities demonstrates his desire to strengthen his relationship with the people of Judah and to show gratitude for their support. ¶Apart from this single reference in the context of David's distribution of the Amalekite spoils, no other information about this specific Aroer is provided in the Bible.

It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, often in the context of defining territorial boundaries and military campaigns. ¶In Deuteronomy 2:36, Aroer is described as being on the edge of the Arnon Valley, marking the southern limit of the territory conquered by the Israelites from King Sihon of the Amorites. This area was later allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Deuteronomy 3:12; Joshua 13:9, 16). ¶Aroer is also mentioned in the description of the extent of King Sihon's territory, which stretched from the Arnon to the Jabbok (Joshua 12:2). During the time of the judges, Jephthah reminded the Ammonites that Israel had possessed the land from Aroer to the Jabbok for three hundred years (Judges 11:26). ¶In the reign of Jehu, king of Israel, the territory from Aroer was lost to Hazael, king of Aram (2 Kings 10:33). The prophet Jeremiah also mentions Aroer in his prophecy concerning Moab, calling upon the inhabitants of Aroer to ask about the destruction that has come upon them (Jeremiah 48:19). ¶Aroer's significance in the Bible lies in its strategic location along the Arnon Valley, serving as a boundary marker and a point of reference in territorial descriptions. Its frequent mention in the context of military campaigns and territorial allotments underscores its importance as a key city in the region.",

The city is also noted in the account of Jephthah's victory over the Ammonites, where he is said to have struck them from Aroer to Minnith (Judges 11:33). ¶During King David's reign, Aroer is mentioned in the context of the census he conducted, which began at Aroer and continued throughout the regions east of the Jordan (2 Samuel 24:5). The city was also the hometown of Shamgar, one of David's mighty men (1 Chronicles 11:44). ¶The prophet Isaiah mentions Aroer in his prophecy concerning Damascus, stating that the cities of Aroer will be forsaken (Isaiah 17:2). This suggests that Aroer, along with other cities in the region, would face judgment and desolation. ¶Aroer's significance in the Bible lies in its association with the tribe of Gad and its location in the Transjordan region.

Jehoiakim, who reigned in the early 6th century BC, was a vassal of Egypt and later Babylon. The mention of Rumah as his mother's place of origin suggests that the city may have been located in the northern kingdom of Israel or in the region of Samaria. ¶The exact location of Arumah or Rumah is uncertain, but some scholars propose that it could be identified with Khirbet el-Ormah, a site about 6 miles (10 km) southeast of Shechem. However, this identification remains tentative. ¶The biblical references to Arumah or Rumah, though brief, provide glimpses into the political and familial connections of significant figures in Israel's history, such as Abimelech and King Jehoiakim.

It is mentioned in Ezekiel 27 as one of the cities that provided skilled mariners and soldiers for the maritime trade and defense of Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city. ¶In Ezekiel's lamentation over Tyre, he describes the city's vast trading network and the various nations that contributed to its wealth and power. Arvad is noted for its role in supplying sailors to navigate Tyre's ships (Ezekiel 27:8) and soldiers to guard its walls (Ezekiel 27:11). This indicates that Arvad had a reputation for producing experienced seafarers and well-trained warriors. ¶Arvad was part of the Phoenician civilization and had a long history of maritime trade and cultural exchange with other Mediterranean nations. The city was situated on a small, rocky island with limited natural resources, which likely contributed to its focus on seafaring and commerce. ¶The biblical mention of Arvad in the context of Tyre's trade and military alliances highlights the interconnected nature of the Phoenician city-states and their shared expertise in navigation and maritime affairs. It also underscores the significance of Arvad as a valuable partner in Tyre's economic and defensive network. ¶Apart from its appearance in Ezekiel's prophecy, Arvad is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. However, its inclusion in this passage provides insight into the geopolitical and commercial landscape of the ancient Near East during the time of Ezekiel's ministry.",

However, in Joshua 19:7 and 1 Chronicles 4:32, Ashan is included in the list of cities given to the tribe of Simeon within Judah's inheritance. ¶Later, in 1 Chronicles 6:59, Ashan is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Levites, specifically to the descendants of Aaron, along with its pasturelands. This suggests that Ashan was designated as a Levitical city, where the priests and Levites resided and served in their sacred duties. ¶The exact location of Ashan is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be situated in the northwestern part of the Judean Shephelah, possibly near the city of Libnah. Some scholars propose identifying Ashan with the modern site of Khirbet Hasan, approximately 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Lachish. ¶The biblical references to Ashan highlight its inclusion in the territorial distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel. Its assignment to both Judah and Simeon and its subsequent designation as a Levitical city underscore the complex process of land allocation and the provision for the Levites within the inherited territories.",

Located in the tribal territory allocated to Judah, it remained predominantly under Philistine control throughout much of its history. ¶The city first appears in biblical records as one of the few places where the Anakim (giants) survived after Joshua's conquest. Though assigned to Judah, it remained a Philistine stronghold. The city gained particular prominence during the episode of the captured Ark of the Covenant. After defeating the Israelites, the Philistines brought the Ark to Ashdod and placed it in the temple of their god Dagon. This resulted in the statue of Dagon falling and breaking, followed by an outbreak of tumors among the city's inhabitants, leading them to send the Ark away. ¶King Uzziah of Judah later broke down the walls of Ashdod and built cities in its territory. The city faced multiple military campaigns, including an Assyrian conquest mentioned by Isaiah. The prophet Amos used Ashdod as a reference point for neighboring nations to witness Egypt's moral corruption. ¶Several prophets pronounced judgment against Ashdod. Jeremiah included it among the cities to drink the cup of God's wrath. Amos, Zephaniah, and Zechariah all prophesied its downfall or conquest. ¶In the post-exilic period, Nehemiah noted that some Jews had married women from Ashdod, resulting in their children speaking the language of Ashdod rather than Hebrew. This was viewed as a serious problem during the restoration of Jerusalem. ¶The city continued to exist into New Testament times, where it is referred to by its Greek name Azotus. It appears in Acts as one of the places where Philip the evangelist preached after his encounter with the Ethiopian eunuch. ¶Probably corresponds to modern Esdud in Israel, located between ancient Joppa and Gaza.",

It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of conflict with Israel and as a target of prophetic judgment. ¶In Judges 1:18, Ashkelon is listed among the cities captured by the tribe of Judah during the conquest of Canaan. However, the city later reverted to Philistine control. Judges 14:19 records that Samson, empowered by the Spirit of the Lord, went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men, and took their garments to pay a debt. ¶Ashkelon is mentioned as one of the Philistine cities that received a golden tumor as a guilt offering when the Ark of the Covenant was returned to Israel (1 Samuel 6:17). In 2 Samuel 1:20, David laments the death of Saul and Jonathan, urging that the news not be proclaimed in Ashkelon, lest the Philistines rejoice. ¶Several prophets, including Jeremiah, Amos, and Zephaniah, pronounce judgments against Ashkelon. Jeremiah includes Ashkelon among the nations that will drink the cup of God's wrath (Jeremiah 25:20) and describes the city as cut off and bereaved (Jeremiah 47:5, 7). Amos prophesies that God will send fire upon Ashkelon (Amos 1:8), while Zephaniah declares that Ashkelon will become a desolation (Zephaniah 2:4) but also foresees a future restoration (Zephaniah 2:7). Zechariah portrays Ashkelon as fearful and mourning in the face of God's judgment (Zechariah 9:5). ¶Throughout its biblical history, Ashkelon remains a significant Philistine stronghold and a symbol of opposition to Israel. The city's inclusion in prophetic oracles underscores its importance and the divine judgment it would face for its hostility toward God's people.",

Some scholars propose that Ashkenaz may have been located in the vicinity of the Caspian Sea or in the region of Armenia. ¶The mention of Ashkenaz in Jeremiah's prophecy suggests that it was a significant power or ally that could contribute to the downfall of Babylon. By including Ashkenaz in the list of nations arrayed against Babylon, the prophet emphasizes the broad coalition that would bring about the city's destruction. ¶Apart from this single reference in Jeremiah, Ashkenaz is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.

This group of cities was located near the border with the tribe of Dan. ¶The second Ashnah is mentioned in Joshua 15:43, grouped with cities such as Jiphtah, Ashnah, and Nezib in the southern part of the Shephelah. This cluster of cities was situated closer to the Negev region. ¶Apart from their inclusion in the lists of Judah's cities, no other information is provided about either of the Ashnahs in the Bible. Their mention in the context of the tribal allotment highlights the process of dividing and assigning the conquered territories among the tribes of Israel. ¶The exact locations of the two Ashnahs are uncertain, and they are not mentioned in any other biblical narratives or historical accounts.

It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in connection with Og, the king of Bashan, who ruled over the city. ¶In Deuteronomy 1:4, Ashtaroth is named as one of the cities defeated by the Israelites, along with Edrei, after they had conquered Sihon, king of the Amorites. Joshua 9:10 and 12:4 also mention Ashtaroth as part of the territory ruled by Og, who was one of the last remnants of the Rephaim, a race of giants. ¶After the conquest of Bashan, Ashtaroth was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Joshua 13:31). However, the city was later designated as a Levitical city, given to the descendants of Gershon (Joshua 21:27; 1 Chronicles 6:71). This indicates that Ashtaroth was one of the cities set apart for the Levites to dwell in and perform their sacred duties. ¶In 1 Chronicles 11:44, Ashtaroth is mentioned as the hometown of Uzzia, one of David's mighty men, suggesting that the city had Israelite inhabitants during the time of David's reign. ¶The name Ashtaroth is also associated with the Canaanite goddess Astarte, and it is possible that the city was a center of her worship before the Israelite conquest. The biblical writers often used the name Ashtaroth to refer to the goddess herself or to the plural form of Astarte, representing multiple goddesses or idols. ¶The city of Ashtaroth was strategically located in the fertile region of Bashan, known for its rich pastures and livestock. Its mention in the Bible highlights the Israelites' victories over the powerful kings of the region and the allotment of the conquered territories to the tribes of Israel, including the Levites.",

It should not be confused with the modern continent of Asia. ¶In Acts, Asia is mentioned several times in the context of Paul's missionary journeys. Jews from Asia were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9), and some belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen, who disputed with Stephen (Acts 6:9). Paul traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia (Acts 16:6). Later, Paul spent two years in Ephesus, and all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord (Acts 19:10). Demetrius, a silversmith who made shrines of Artemis, stirred up a crowd against Paul, fearing that Paul's preaching would undermine the worship of Artemis, whom all Asia revered (Acts 19:26-27). ¶In his farewell address to the Ephesian elders, Paul mentions that he had faced plots by the Jews from Asia (Acts 20:18-19). When Paul visited the temple in Jerusalem, Jews from Asia stirred up the crowd against him (Acts 21:27). During Paul's voyage to Rome, the ship stopped at Myra in Lycia, where an Alexandrian ship was found sailing for Italy (Acts 27:2). ¶The churches in Asia are mentioned in the opening of 1 Peter (1 Peter 1:1) and Revelation (Revelation 1:4, 11). Paul also sends greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and to the church in their house, the first fruits of Asia (1 Corinthians 16:19; Romans 16:5). In 2 Timothy, Paul writes that all those in Asia had turned away from him (2 Timothy 1:15). ¶These references to Asia in the New Testament provide insight into the early spread of Christianity and the challenges faced by the apostles in this region of the Roman Empire.",

Some scholars suggest that Paul may have wanted to visit friends or churches along the way, or that he needed time alone for prayer and reflection. ¶Assos was situated on the Aegean coast, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Troas. It was known for its strong walls, which were built from the local volcanic rock. The city also had a significant harbor and was an important trade center in the region. ¶Apart from this brief mention in Acts, Assos does not play a significant role in the New Testament narrative. However, its inclusion in the account of Paul's journey provides a glimpse into the geographical and maritime context of the apostle's travels and the early spread of Christianity in Asia Minor.",

    "longDescription": "Assyria, also known as Asshur, was a powerful ancient empire centered in Mesopotamia, in what is now modern-day Iraq. The Assyrians are mentioned extensively throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of their military conquests and their interactions with the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. ¶The name \"Asshur\" first appears in Genesis 10:11, where it is associated with Nimrod, who is said to have built several cities, including Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. In Genesis 25:18, the descendants of Ishmael are described as living in the region from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as one goes toward Assyria. ¶Assyria began to emerge as a significant power in the 9th century BC, and its kings are mentioned in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III is recorded as receiving tribute from Jehu, king of Israel (2 Kings 15:19-20). Later, Tiglath-Pileser III, also known as Pul, conquered parts of Israel and deported some of its inhabitants (2 Kings 15:29; 1 Chronicles 5:6, 26). ¶The Assyrian Empire reached its zenith during the reign of Sennacherib, who is known for his military campaigns against Judah and his siege of Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah (2 Kings 18-19; 2 Chronicles 32; Isaiah 36-37). The prophet Isaiah played a significant role in encouraging Hezekiah to trust in God and resist the Assyrian threat. ¶Other Assyrian kings, such as Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, are also mentioned in the Bible (Ezra 4:2; 2 Chronicles 33:11). The fall of the Assyrian Empire is alluded to in the prophetic books, particularly in Nahum, which foretells the destruction of Nineveh (Nahum 3:18-19).",

The name Abel-mizraim means \"mourning of the Egyptians,\" referring to the seven-day period of lamentation observed by the Egyptians accompanying Joseph. The threshing floor of Atad was likely a prominent landmark in the region, suitable for a large gathering. Its location east of the Jordan suggests that it was in the territory later allotted to the tribes of Reuben or Gad.",

The town is listed along with Beth-horon as marking the extent of Ephraim's inheritance. ¶In Joshua 18:13, Ataroth-addar appears again in the delineation of Benjamin's territory. The verse states that the border extended from there to Ataroth-addar, near the hill south of Lower Beth-horon. This description places Ataroth-addar in the vicinity of Beth-horon, a strategically important town in the western foothills of the central hill country. ¶The name Ataroth-addar likely combines two elements: \"Ataroth,\" meaning \"crowns\" or \"wreaths,\" and \"Addar,\" which may be a personal name or a descriptive term. The exact location of Ataroth-addar is not known with certainty, but its repeated mention in the boundary descriptions underscores its significance as a border town between Ephraim and Benjamin. ¶Apart from its role in demarcating tribal territories, no other information about Ataroth-addar is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary lists of Joshua highlights the importance of establishing clear territorial divisions among the tribes of Israel as they settled in the Promised Land.",

The context of 1 Samuel 30 suggests that Athach was among the towns where David had previously found support and refuge during his time fleeing from King Saul. ¶David's act of sharing the spoils with Athach and other towns demonstrates his gratitude for their assistance and his desire to strengthen his relationships with the people of Judah. This gesture also foreshadows David's future role as king over all Israel, as he sought to build alliances and establish his authority in the region. ¶Apart from this single reference in 1 Samuel, no other information about Athach is provided in the Bible.

The attack by the Canaanite king of Arad was a significant challenge for the Israelites, as it threatened their progress and security in the region. ¶In response to this attack, the Israelites made a vow to the Lord, promising to utterly destroy the Canaanite cities if God would deliver them into their hands. God heard their plea and gave them victory over the Canaanites, leading to the destruction of their cities and the renaming of the place as Hormah, meaning \"destruction\" (Numbers 21:2-3). ¶The event at Atharim highlights the ongoing challenges and conflicts the Israelites faced during their wilderness journey, as well as their dependence on God's protection and intervention in the face of enemy attacks.

While waiting for them in Athens, Paul was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols. ¶Paul's time in Athens was marked by his interactions with the local philosophers and his famous sermon at the Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill (Acts 17:19-34). He engaged in discussions with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, who were intrigued by his teaching about Jesus and the resurrection. Some of them brought Paul to the Areopagus, where he delivered a discourse, starting with a reference to an altar dedicated to an unknown god. ¶In his sermon, Paul proclaimed the one true God, the Creator of all things, and called for repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. While some mocked Paul's message, others believed, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris. ¶After his time in Athens, Paul traveled to Corinth (Acts 18:1), where he continued his ministry. Later, in his letters to the Thessalonians, Paul mentioned sending Timothy to them from Athens to strengthen and encourage them in their faith (1 Thessalonians 3:1-2).",

The Philistines gathered their armies between Socoh and Azekah before the famous battle between David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17:1). During the reign of King Rehoboam, Azekah was one of the cities fortified for the defense of Judah (2 Chronicles 11:9). After the Babylonian exile, Azekah was reinhabited by the Jews (Nehemiah 11:30). The city was one of the last two strongholds, along with Lachish, to fall to the Babylonians during the siege of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 34:7). Archaeological excavations at the site of Tel Azekah have revealed evidence of the city's occupation from the Bronze Age through the Babylonian destruction.",

The Reubenites rebuilt the city and renamed it, possibly to remove its association with the Canaanite deity Baal (Numbers 32:38). However, the town later reverted to Moabite control, as evidenced by its mention in the prophecies against Moab (Jeremiah 48:23; Ezekiel 25:9). The town was located in the territory of the Moabites, east of the Dead Sea (Numbers 32:3).

The name \"Baal-zephon\" means \"Lord of the North\" or \"Baal of the North,\" possibly referring to a local deity worshipped by the Egyptians in that area.",

    "longDescription": "Babylon, also known as Babel, was an ancient city located in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) along the Euphrates River. It served as the capital of the Babylonian Empire, one of the most powerful empires in the ancient Near East. The city first appears in the Bible in Genesis 10:10 as part of Nimrod's kingdom and is identified as the location of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:9). ¶Throughout the Old Testament, Babylon is mentioned as a major political and military power, often in conflict with Israel and Judah. The city became the dominant power in the region under King Nebuchadnezzar II, who conquered Judah, destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple, and exiled many Jews to Babylon (2 Kings 24-25; 2 Chronicles 36). The Babylonian captivity lasted for 70 years, as prophesied by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:11; 29:10). ¶Several Old Testament prophets, including Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, prophesied against Babylon, foretelling its eventual downfall (Isaiah 13-14; Jeremiah 50-51; Ezekiel 26-32). In these prophecies, Babylon is sometimes referred to by other names, such as Sheshak (Jeremiah 25:26; 51:41), Merathaim (Jeremiah 50:21), and Pekod (Jeremiah 50:21; Ezekiel 23:23), which are believed to be code names or references to specific regions within the Babylonian Empire. ¶After the Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC, the city gradually declined in importance. In the New Testament, Babylon is used symbolically to represent worldly power and opposition to God (Revelation 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21).",

It is mentioned several times in the Bible, primarily in connection with events during the reign of King David. ¶In 2 Samuel 3:16, Bahurim is mentioned as the place where Michal, David's wife, was returned to him by her husband Paltiel, as ordered by David. Later, when David was fleeing from his son Absalom, Shimei, a member of Saul's clan from Bahurim, cursed and threw stones at David and his men (2 Samuel 16:5). However, when David returned to Jerusalem after Absalom's defeat, Shimei met him at the Jordan River and apologized for his actions (2 Samuel 19:16; 1 Kings 2:8). ¶Bahurim is also mentioned as the hometown of Azmaveth, one of David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23:31; 1 Chronicles 11:33). Additionally, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, the sons of the priests Abiathar and Zadok, hid in a well at Bahurim to avoid being captured by Absalom's men while relaying information to David (2 Samuel 17:18).",

High places were elevated locations where pagan worship and sacrifices were often conducted. ¶The prophecy in Isaiah 15 foretells the judgment and devastation that would come upon Moab, a nation that had a history of conflict with Israel. The mention of the Moabites going to Bajith to weep and mourn highlights their distress and the futility of seeking help from their pagan gods in the face of God's judgment.",

The land of Bashan was allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Numbers 32:33; Joshua 13:29-31). ¶The region was known for its strong oak trees (Isaiah 2:13; Ezekiel 27:6) and its well-nourished cattle, often referred to as the \"bulls of Bashan\" (Deuteronomy 32:14; Psalm 22:12; Amos 4:1). It was also famous for its rich pastures (Jeremiah 50:19; Micah 7:14) and its fertile soil, which was well-suited for growing crops (Psalm 135:11; 136:20). ¶Bashan was one of the regions from which Solomon received supplies for his royal court (1 Kings 4:13). It was also the homeland of Golan, one of the cities of refuge designated by Moses (Deuteronomy 4:43; Joshua 20:8; 21:27). ¶Several Old Testament passages use Bashan as a symbol of God's power and judgment (Psalm 68:15, 22; Isaiah 33:9; Jeremiah 22:20; Ezekiel 39:18; Zechariah 11:2). The region was also mentioned in the context of God's blessings and provision for His people (Deuteronomy 33:22; Nehemiah 9:22).",

It was the location where the apostle Peter, accompanied by John, encountered a man who had been lame from birth. The man was carried daily to the gate to ask for alms from those entering the temple courts. ¶As Peter and John approached the gate, the man asked them for money. Instead, Peter commanded the man to walk in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Instantly, the man's feet and ankles were made strong, and he began to walk, leap, and praise God. This miracle attracted the attention of the people, who were astonished to see the man walking and praising God. ¶The exact location and appearance of the Beautiful Gate are not described in detail in the Bible. It is believed to have been one of the main entrances to the temple complex, possibly leading from the Court of the Gentiles to the Court of Women. The gate's name suggests that it was likely an ornate and impressive structure. ¶The healing of the lame man at the Beautiful Gate was a significant event in the early church, demonstrating the power of the risen Christ and the authority of the apostles to perform miracles in His name. It also provided an opportunity for Peter to preach the gospel to the gathered crowd, resulting in many people coming to believe in Jesus (Acts 3:11-26).",

The Angel spoke to Hagar, encouraging her and instructing her to return to Sarah and submit to her. Hagar responded by calling the name of the Lord \"You are the God who sees,\" and she named the well Beer-lahai-roi (Genesis 16:14). ¶Later, in Genesis 24:62, it is mentioned that Isaac, Abraham's son, was living in the Negev and had come from Beer-lahai-roi when Rebekah arrived to become his wife. After Abraham's death, Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi (Genesis 25:11). ¶The well of Beer-lahai-roi served as a significant location in the story of Hagar and her encounters with God.

The city was located in the region north of Jerusalem, near Gibeon and Kiriath-jearim. ¶Beeroth is mentioned in connection with several events in the Bible. It was the hometown of two of David's mighty men, Naharai (2 Samuel 23:37; 1 Chronicles 11:39) and Rechab and Baanah, who murdered Ish-bosheth, Saul's son (2 Samuel 4:2-3, 5, 9). After the Babylonian exile, some of the people of Beeroth returned to Judah (Ezra 2:25; Nehemiah 7:29). ¶In Judges 9:21, Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, fled to Beer (possibly another name for Beeroth) for safety after confronting the people of Shechem about their support for his half-brother Abimelech, who had killed Jotham's brothers. ¶The city of Beeroth played a role in the early history of Israel, first as a Canaanite city that deceived the Israelites, then as part of the tribe of Benjamin's inheritance, and later as the hometown of some of David's mighty men and a place of refuge for Jotham.",

    "longDescription": "Beersheba, also known as Sheba or Shibah, was a significant city located in the Negev region of southern Israel. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament and is closely associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Israel (or 'Jacob'). ¶The name \"Beersheba\" first appears in Genesis 21:31, where Abraham named the place after making a covenant with Abimelech, the king of Gerar. The name means \"well of seven\" or \"well of the oath,\" referring to the seven ewe lambs that Abraham gave to Abimelech as a witness to the covenant (Genesis 21:28-31). ¶Abraham lived in Beersheba for a time (Genesis 22:19), and it was from there that he set out to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice in the land of Moriah (Genesis 22:1-19). Isaac also lived in Beersheba, where he built an altar and called upon the name of the Lord (Genesis 26:23-25, 33). Jacob left Beersheba to go to Haran (Genesis 28:10) and later returned there to offer sacrifices to God before going to Egypt (Genesis 46:1, 5). ¶In the later history of Israel, Beersheba marked the southern extent of the nation, as seen in the phrase \"from Dan to Beersheba\" (Judges 20:1; 1 Samuel 3:20; 2 Samuel 3:10; 17:11; 24:2, 15; 1 Kings 4:25). The city was allotted to the tribe of Simeon (Joshua 19:2) and became part of the kingdom of Judah (2 Samuel 24:7). ¶Beersheba was also a center of idolatry, as evidenced by the references to the \"way of Beersheba\" (Amos 8:14) and the \"sin of Samaria\" (Amos 5:5). King Josiah removed the idolatrous priests and destroyed the high places from Geba to Beersheba as part of his religious reforms (2 Kings 23:8). ¶In summary, Beersheba was a prominent city in the Negev, serving as a key location in the lives of the patriarchs and later as a boundary marker for the nation of Israel. Its history was marked by both faithfulness to God and idolatry.",

This incident occurred after Jeremiah had prophesied about the impending destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of its people. ¶Later, in Jeremiah 37:13, the prophet was arrested by the guard at the Benjamin Gate when he was attempting to leave Jerusalem during the Babylonian siege of the city. The guard accused Jeremiah of defecting to the Babylonians, but the prophet denied the charge. ¶In Jeremiah 38:7, Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch in the king's house, heard that Jeremiah had been put into a cistern in the court of the guard. He went to the king at the Benjamin Gate to intercede on Jeremiah's behalf, and the king ordered Ebed-melech to take men and lift Jeremiah out of the cistern. ¶The Benjamin Gate served as a significant location in the book of Jeremiah, being associated with the prophet's persecution, arrest, and rescue. Its mention in these passages highlights the political and religious tensions in Jerusalem during the time leading up to the Babylonian exile.",

This description suggests that the Benjamin Gate was one of the key landmarks in Jerusalem's wall, possibly located on the northern side of the city, facing the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. ¶The prophecy in Zechariah 14 speaks of a future time when Jerusalem will be exalted and secure, with the Lord being king over all the earth. The mention of the Benjamin Gate in this context highlights its significance as part of the restored and transformed city. ¶It is worth noting that the Benjamin Gate mentioned in Zechariah may not necessarily be the same gate as the one referenced in the book of Jeremiah, as the two prophets lived at different times in history.

Many of the Bereans believed, including prominent Greek women and men. However, when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching in Berea, they came and stirred up trouble, forcing Paul to leave the city (Acts 17:13-14). Sopater, a believer from Berea, later accompanied Paul on his return trip to Asia (Acts 20:4).

As they came to the Brook Besor, two hundred of David's men were too exhausted to continue the pursuit and remained behind (1 Samuel 30:9-10). David and the remaining four hundred men crossed the brook and eventually overtook the Amalekites, defeating them and recovering all that had been taken, including their families. On their return, they met the two hundred men who had stayed at the Brook Besor, and David insisted that they share equally in the spoils of victory (1 Samuel 30:21-25). The exact location of the Brook Besor is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the Negev region, south of Ziklag.

It was in Bethany that Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, performing one of His most significant miracles (John 11:1-44). This event took place shortly before Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (John 12:1, 9-11). ¶Bethany was also the place where Jesus was anointed by Mary, who poured expensive perfume on His feet and wiped them with her hair (Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8). This act of devotion took place in the house of Simon the leper, and it was criticized by Judas Iscariot as a waste of money. ¶In the Synoptic Gospels, Bethany is mentioned in connection with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:1, 17; Mark 11:1, 11-12; Luke 19:29). Jesus sent two of His disciples to Bethany to find a colt for Him to ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. ¶After His resurrection, Jesus led His disciples out as far as Bethany before ascending into heaven (Luke 24:50-51). The village held a special place in Jesus' ministry, serving as a place of rest, friendship, and significant events. ¶In John 1:28, a different Bethany is mentioned, which is specified as \"Bethany beyond the Jordan.\" This Bethany was located on the eastern side of the Jordan River, where John the Baptist was baptizing people. It should not be confused with the Bethany near Jerusalem.",

Some scholars believe that Beth-arbel may refer to the city of Arbela, located in the region of Galilee, which was known for its fortified caves. Others suggest that it might be a reference to the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III or Shalmaneser V, who were involved in campaigns against Israel and Judah. ¶The destruction of Beth-arbel is used by Hosea as an example of the impending judgment that would come upon Israel because of their unfaithfulness to God.

Ashtoreth, also known as Astarte, was a Canaanite goddess of love, fertility, and war, often associated with the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar and the Greek goddess Aphrodite. ¶The exact location of Beth-Ashtoreth is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely a significant Philistine city with a prominent temple dedicated to Ashtoreth. The placement of Saul's armor in the temple was a way for the Philistines to celebrate their victory over Israel and to attribute their success to their goddess. ¶The event also highlights the tragic end of Saul's reign and the humiliation that befell him and Israel as a result of their defeat at the hands of the Philistines. In contrast, 1 Chronicles 10:10 mentions that Saul's head was put in the temple of Dagon, another Philistine deity, showing the widespread celebration of the Philistine victory.",

Later, in 1 Samuel 13:5, the Philistines gathered their forces at Michmash, east of Beth-aven, in preparation for battle against Israel. During this conflict, Saul's son Jonathan and his armor-bearer initiated an attack on the Philistine garrison, which led to a great victory for Israel (1 Samuel 14:1-23). ¶The prophets Hosea and Amos used Beth-aven as a derogatory term for Bethel, which had become a center of idolatry in Israel (Hosea 4:15; 5:8; 10:5).

    "longDescription": "Beth-barah, also known as Bethabara, is mentioned in two different contexts in the Bible. In Judges 7:24, during Gideon's battle against the Midianites, he sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, asking the Ephraimites to intercept the fleeing Midianites at the waters of Beth-barah and the Jordan. The Ephraimites captured and killed the two Midianite princes, Oreb and Zeeb. ¶In John 1:28, Bethabara is mentioned as the place where John the Baptist was baptizing people. This Bethabara is described as being \"beyond the Jordan,\" indicating that it was on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Some manuscripts mention \"Bethany\" instead of \"Bethabara\" in this verse, which has led to some confusion. However, the Bethany mentioned here is not the same as the village near Jerusalem associated with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. ¶The exact location of Beth-barah/Bethabara is uncertain, but it was likely a ford or crossing point along the Jordan River, possibly in the vicinity of the Jabbok River. The name Beth-barah means \"house of the crossing\" or \"house of the ford\" in Hebrew, which supports this interpretation.",

However, as the Philistines approached, the Lord sent a loud thunder upon them, causing confusion and panic in their ranks. The Israelites then pursued the Philistines and struck them down from Mizpah to a place below Beth-car. ¶The name Beth-car means \"house of the lamb\" or \"house of pasture\" in Hebrew. The exact location of Beth-car is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, west of Mizpah, in the direction of the Philistine cities. ¶The victory at Beth-car was significant for the Israelites, as it marked the beginning of a period of peace and the end of Philistine oppression during Samuel's leadership. The pursuit of the Philistines to Beth-car demonstrates the Israelites' renewed confidence and trust in the Lord's protection and guidance.",

    "longDescription": "Beth-eked, meaning \"house of binding\" or \"shearing house\" in Hebrew, is mentioned in 2 Kings 10:12 and 14 in the context of Jehu's purge of the house of Ahab and the royal family of Judah. After Jehu had killed King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah, he set out to eliminate any potential rivals to his claim to the throne. ¶On his way to Samaria, Jehu came to Beth-eked, where he encountered forty-two brothers of Ahaziah. These men were likely coming to visit the royal family in Samaria, unaware of the recent coup. Jehu ordered his men to take the brothers alive and then slaughter them at the pit of Beth-eked. The text emphasizes that Jehu killed all forty-two men, leaving none of them alive. ¶The exact location of Beth-eked is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated between Jezreel and Samaria, possibly serving as a resting place for travelers or a center for sheep-shearing. The name \"Beth-eked\" suggests that it may have been a place where sheep were bound for shearing. ¶Jehu's actions at Beth-eked were part of his larger campaign to eliminate the house of Ahab and establish himself as the new king of Israel. His purge was seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Elijah against the house of Ahab (1 Kings 21:21-24). ¶",

This gesture was part of David's political strategy of building alliances with the towns of Judah. ¶ Probably corresponds to the settlement called Bethuel in some passages, though its exact modern location remains uncertain. ¶ Note: Care must be taken not to confuse this southern Bethel with the more prominent northern city of the same name where significant events in the lives of Abraham, Jacob, and Jeroboam took place.

    "longDescription": "Bethel, meaning \"house of God\" in Hebrew, was an important city in ancient Israel, located about 10 miles north of Jerusalem. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament and is closely associated with the patriarchs Abraham and Israel (or 'Jacob'). ¶The city was originally called Luz (Genesis 28:19; 35:6; 48:3; Judges 1:23) and was renamed Bethel by Jacob after his vision of a ladder reaching to heaven (Genesis 28:10-22). In this vision, God confirmed the covenant He had made with Abraham and promised to be with Jacob wherever he went. Jacob set up a stone pillar at the site, anointed it with oil, and made a vow to God. ¶Abraham had previously built an altar between Bethel and Ai (Genesis 12:8; 13:3), and Jacob later returned to Bethel, where he built an altar and received a renewed promise from God (Genesis 35:1-15). The place was also called El-bethel, meaning \"God of Bethel\" (Genesis 35:7). ¶During the period of the judges, Deborah held court under a palm tree between Ramah and Bethel (Judges 4:5), and the Israelites went up to Bethel to seek guidance from God (Judges 20:18, 26; 21:2). The Ark of the Covenant was temporarily located at Bethel (Judges 20:27). ¶After the division of the kingdom, Jeroboam I set up a golden calf at Bethel to prevent the people from going to Jerusalem to worship (1 Kings 12:28-33). This act led to Bethel becoming a major center of idolatry, and the prophets Amos and Hosea condemned the worship there (Amos 3:14; 4:4; 5:5-6; 7:10, 13; Hosea 10:5, 8, 15). ¶The city was called Aven, meaning \"wickedness,\" by Hosea (Hosea 10:8) and Beth-aven, meaning \"house of wickedness,\" in other passages (Joshua 7:2; 18:12; 1 Samuel 13:5; 14:23), likely referring to its association with idolatry. ¶Bethel was destroyed by King Josiah during his religious reforms (2 Kings 23:4, 15-19) but was later resettled after the Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:28; Nehemiah 7:32; 11:31). ¶The city was also known as Bochim, meaning \"weepers,\" in Judges 2:1, 5, where an angel of the Lord rebuked the Israelites for their disobedience. ¶Bethel played a significant role in Israel's history, serving as a place of worship, a center of idolatry, and a symbol of God's presence and promises to His people.",

Some scholars suggest that \"Bether\" may not refer to a specific geographical location but rather serve as a symbolic or poetic term. ¶The word \"Bether\" comes from a Hebrew root meaning \"to divide\" or \"to cut,\" which has led some interpreters to understand the phrase \"mountains of Bether\" as referring to \"mountains of separation\" or \"cleft mountains.\" This interpretation would fit the context of the Song of Solomon, which explores themes of love, longing, and separation between the lovers. ¶In this view, the mountains of Bether represent the obstacles or distances that separate the lovers, and the beloved is invited to come swiftly, like a gazelle or young stag, to overcome these barriers. The imagery of the gazelle and stag also suggests the agility, grace, and strength needed to traverse the rugged terrain of the mountains. ¶Other interpretations propose that the mountains of Bether may refer to a specific location, possibly in the region of Lebanon or Anti-Lebanon, known for its rugged terrain and natural beauty.

    "shortDescription": "Bethesda (Bethzatha) was a pool in Jerusalem with five roofed colonnades, where Jesus healed a man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. (John 5:2)",
    "longDescription": "Bethesda, also known as Bethzatha, was a pool located in Jerusalem, mentioned in the Gospel of John. The name Bethesda is derived from the Hebrew term meaning \"house of mercy\" or \"house of grace,\" while Bethzatha comes from the Aramaic, meaning \"house of olives\" or \"house of the olive tree.\" ¶The pool is described as having five roofed colonnades or porticoes, suggesting a structure with covered walkways surrounding the pool. It was located near the Sheep Gate, which was likely a gate in the northern wall of the city, used for bringing sheep into Jerusalem for sacrificial purposes. ¶In John 5:1-15, Jesus visits the Pool of Bethesda and encounters a man who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. The man explains that he has been unable to enter the pool when the water is stirred up, as someone else always steps in before him. It was believed that an angel would periodically come down and stir up the water, and the first person to enter the pool after this would be healed of their infirmities. ¶Jesus, seeing the man and knowing his long-standing condition, asks him, \"Do you want to get well?\" The man responds by explaining his inability to enter the pool first. Jesus then commands him, \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\" Instantly, the man is healed, takes up his mat, and starts walking. ¶This miracle leads to a controversy, as it occurred on the Sabbath, and the Jewish leaders considered carrying a mat on the Sabbath to be a violation of the law. Jesus later finds the man in the temple and advises him to stop sinning, lest something worse happens to him. ¶The Pool of Bethesda is an example of Jesus' power to heal and his authority over the Sabbath. It also highlights the contrast between the man's long-standing infirmity and the instantaneous nature of Jesus' healing. ¶Archaeologists have uncovered a site near the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem, which is believed to be the location of the Pool of Bethesda. The excavations revealed a pool with multiple porticoes, consistent with the biblical description.",

The towns mentioned in the surrounding verses, such as Shaphir, Zaanan, and Maroth, are also believed to be in this general area. ¶Micah's prophecy suggests that Beth-ezel would be unable to provide support or refuge to the inhabitants of the nearby town of Zaanan during the coming judgment. The phrase \"the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall take away from you its standing place\" indicates that Beth-ezel itself would be affected by the calamity and unable to offer assistance. ¶The prophecy against Beth-ezel and the other towns in Judah serves as a warning of the impending judgment due to the people's sins and a call to repentance and humility before God. The fate of Beth-ezel is tied to the larger narrative of God's judgment against Judah and the surrounding nations.",

In Nehemiah 3:14, it is listed as one of the sections of Jerusalem's wall that was repaired by Malchijah, the son of Rechab, who was the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem. This suggests that Beth-haccherem was a town or region near Jerusalem, possibly located in the hill country of Judah. ¶In Jeremiah 6:1, the prophet warns the people of Benjamin to flee from Jerusalem and to raise a signal fire in Beth-haccherem, as disaster and great destruction were coming from the north. This warning comes in the context of the impending Babylonian invasion and the judgment that would befall Jerusalem and Judah. ¶The mention of raising a signal fire in Beth-haccherem suggests that the town may have been situated on a high point or had a watchtower that could be used to send signals to the surrounding areas. Signal fires were used in ancient times to warn of approaching danger or to communicate important messages quickly over long distances. ¶The reference in Nehemiah indicates that Beth-haccherem had a ruler or administrator, implying that it was a town of some significance. Its proximity to Jerusalem and its role in the defense system of the city further underscore its importance. ¶The location of the town remains uncertain.",

When Ahaziah saw what had happened, he fled by the way of the garden house (Beth-haggan). Jehu pursued him and ordered his men to shoot Ahaziah in his chariot. Ahaziah was wounded and managed to escape to Megiddo, where he died. ¶The exact location of Beth-haggan is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated near Jezreel, the site of Joram's death. Jezreel was a significant city in the northern kingdom of Israel, serving as a royal residence for the Omride dynasty. ¶The mention of Beth-haggan as the place where Ahaziah fled suggests that it may have been a fortified location or a place of refuge. The name \"house of the garden\" may indicate the presence of a royal garden or a lush, well-watered area near Jezreel. ¶The death of Ahaziah at Megiddo, after fleeing from Beth-haggan, marked the end of his brief reign as king of Judah and solidified Jehu's position as the new ruler of Israel.

This occurred after the Israelites had conquered the territories east of the Jordan and before they crossed the river to enter the Promised Land. ¶In Joshua 13:27, Beth-haram is listed among the towns allotted to the tribe of Gad in the Jordan Valley, along with Beth-nimrah and Succoth. This passage describes the extent of Gad's territory, which stretched from the Jabbok River in the south to the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee) in the north. ¶The fortification of Beth-haram by the Gadites suggests that it was a strategically important town, possibly guarding a trade route or serving as a defensive outpost. Its location in the Jordan Valley would have made it a valuable agricultural area, benefiting from the fertile soil and the proximity to water sources. ¶No other details about Beth-haram are provided in the Bible, and the exact location of the town remains uncertain.

Lower Beth-horon was situated in a strategic location along the main road connecting the coastal plain with Jerusalem and the interior of the country. ¶In the book of Joshua, Lower Beth-horon is described as part of the border between Ephraim and Benjamin (Joshua 16:3; 18:13). It was allotted to the Kohathite clan of the Levites (Joshua 21:22; 1 Chronicles 6:68). ¶The most famous biblical event associated with Lower Beth-horon is the battle between the Israelites and the Amorite kings, described in Joshua 10. As the Amorites fled before Israel, God cast down large hailstones on them, and Joshua prayed for the sun to stand still, allowing the Israelites to complete their victory (Joshua 10:10-11). ¶In later history, Lower Beth-horon was fortified by King Solomon (1 Kings 9:17; 2 Chronicles 8:5) and was the site of a battle between Judah and Israel during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah (2 Chronicles 25:13). ¶The Philistines also used the Beth-horon road as one of their main routes for invading Israelite territory (1 Samuel 13:18). ¶Both Lower and Upper Beth-horon were rebuilt by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim (1 Chronicles 7:24). ¶Today, the ancient site of Lower Beth-horon is identified with the modern Palestinian village of Beit Ur al-Tahta.",

It was situated in the central hill country of Israel, not far from its sister city, Lower Beth-horon. ¶The name Beth-horon means \"house of caves\" or \"house of hollows\" in Hebrew, possibly referring to the topography of the area. Upper Beth-horon was located at a higher elevation than Lower Beth-horon and was connected to it by a road known as the Ascent of Beth-horon. ¶In Joshua 16:5, Upper Beth-horon is mentioned as part of the description of Ephraim's border. The town was rebuilt by Sheerah, the daughter of Ephraim, along with Lower Beth-horon (1 Chronicles 7:24). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Upper Beth-horon was one of the cities he fortified as part of his building projects (2 Chronicles 8:5). This fortification was likely due to the town's strategic location along the road connecting the coastal plain with the interior of the country. ¶Although Upper Beth-horon is mentioned less frequently in the Bible than Lower Beth-horon, its proximity to the latter and its inclusion in the list of fortified cities suggest that it played a significant role in the defense and administration of the region. ¶Today, the ancient site of Upper Beth-horon is identified with the modern Palestinian village of Beit Ur al-Foqa.",

The camp extended from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim. ¶After the conquest of Canaan, Beth-jeshimoth was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Joshua 13:20). It was situated in the Arabah, the Jordan Valley, south of the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee). ¶In Joshua 12:3, Beth-jeshimoth is listed among the cities and territories conquered by the Israelites under Moses' leadership, along with the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites. ¶The prophet Ezekiel, in a prophecy against Moab, mentions Beth-jeshimoth as one of the cities that would be given to the people of the East as a possession, along with Baal-meon and Kiriathaim (Ezekiel 25:9). This prophecy indicates that Beth-jeshimoth was a significant Moabite town and that it would share the fate of other cities in the region due to Moab's pride and hostility towards Israel. ¶The exact location of Beth-jeshimoth is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the northeastern shore of the Dead Sea, possibly at the site known as Khirbet es-Suweimeh.",

It was also the hometown of Ibzan, one of the judges of Israel (Judges 12:8, 10). ¶During the period of the judges, a Levite from Bethlehem became a priest for Micah's idolatrous shrine (Judges 17:7-9). Later, a Levite from Bethlehem traveled to Gibeah, where his concubine was mistreated, leading to a war between the Israelites and the Benjamites (Judges 19:1-2, 18). ¶The book of Ruth is set primarily in Bethlehem, where Naomi and her family were from (Ruth 1:1-2, 19, 22). Boaz, who married Ruth, was also from Bethlehem (Ruth 2:4; 4:11). ¶Bethlehem is most famously known as the hometown of King David (1 Samuel 16:1, 18; 17:12, 15; 20:6, 28). It was in Bethlehem that Samuel anointed David as the future king of Israel (1 Samuel 16:4). During David's reign, the city was referred to as the \"city of David\" (Luke 2:4, 11). ¶Several of David's mighty men, including Abishai and Elhanan, were from Bethlehem (2 Samuel 23:24; 1 Chronicles 11:26; 2 Samuel 21:19). ¶In the New Testament, Bethlehem is celebrated as the birthplace of Jesus Christ (Matthew 2:1, 5-6, 8, 16; Luke 2:4, 15; John 7:42). The Magi visited Jesus in Bethlehem, and King Herod ordered the massacre of the innocents there in an attempt to kill the newborn king (Matthew 2:16). ¶The prophet Micah foretold that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), and this prophecy is cited in Matthew 2:5-6.",

The king left the city with his entire household, except for ten concubines who were left to take care of the palace. ¶David and his followers stopped at a place some distance from the city, which is referred to as Beth-merchak. The text does not provide the exact location of this place, but it was likely a short distance from Jerusalem, possibly a suburb or a neighboring village. ¶At Beth-merchak, David reviewed the people who were with him, including his servants and loyal followers.

    "longDescription": "Beth-millo, meaning \"house of the filling\" or \"house of the rampart\" in Hebrew, was a fortified place or citadel within the city of Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim. It is mentioned in the context of Abimelech's rise to power and his subsequent conflict with the people of Shechem. ¶In Judges 9:6, the men of Shechem and Beth-millo gathered together to make Abimelech, the son of Gideon (Jerubbaal), king over them. This event took place by the terebinth tree at the pillar in Shechem, suggesting that Beth-millo was a significant part of the city and that its inhabitants had a say in the selection of their ruler. ¶However, the relationship between Abimelech and the people of Shechem and Beth-millo deteriorated over time. In Judges 9:20, Jotham, Abimelech's half-brother, prophesied that fire would come from Abimelech to devour the men of Shechem and Beth-millo and that fire would come from them to devour Abimelech. This prophecy came true when the men of Shechem turned against Abimelech and he, in turn, destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants (Judges 9:23-49). ¶The exact nature and location of Beth-millo within Shechem are not specified in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that it may have been a fortified citadel or a residential area for the city's upper class. Others propose that it could have been a part of the city's defensive structures, such as a filled-in rampart or a tower. ¶The story of Abimelech and Beth-millo highlights the political instability and power struggles that characterized the period of the judges in Israel's history. It also demonstrates the consequences of making alliances with those who do not follow God's ways.",

It is mentioned twice in the Bible, first in Joshua 15:27 as part of the list of towns allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land. ¶The second mention of Beth-pelet is in Nehemiah 11:26, where it is listed among the towns resettled by the people of Judah after their return from the Babylonian exile. This suggests that Beth-pelet was one of the towns that had been inhabited by the Judahites before the exile and was later reoccupied when they returned to their homeland. ¶The exact location of Beth-pelet is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the arid region south of Hebron, along with other towns mentioned in the same context, such as Moladah, Hazar-shual, and Beersheba. ¶No other information about Beth-pelet is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its name, \"house of escape\" or \"house of flight,\" may refer to its function as a place of refuge or to a local event or feature associated with escape or flight.",

    "longDescription": "Beth-peor, meaning \"house of Peor\" or \"temple of Peor\" in Hebrew, was a place located east of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab. It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and the events leading up to their entry into the Promised Land. ¶In Deuteronomy 3:29, Beth-peor is mentioned as the place where the Israelites camped before Moses delivered his final discourses to the people. The text specifies that they stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor. ¶Deuteronomy 4:46 again refers to Beth-peor as the location where Moses spoke to the Israelites, giving them the statutes and judgments that they were to observe in the land they were about to enter. ¶The most significant event associated with Beth-peor is the death and burial of Moses. In Deuteronomy 34:6, it is recorded that Moses died in the land of Moab and was buried in a valley opposite Beth-peor. However, the exact location of his grave remains unknown, as the text states that \"no one knows his grave to this day.\" ¶In Joshua 13:20, Beth-peor is mentioned as part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben, along with other cities in the plains of Moab. ¶The name Beth-peor suggests that the place was associated with the worship of the Moabite god Peor. This connection is further supported by the events recorded in Numbers 25, where the Israelites engaged in idolatry and sexual immorality with the Moabites, worshipping Baal of Peor. As a result, a plague struck the Israelites, and Moses was commanded to execute the leaders of the people. ¶The location of Beth-peor is not precisely known, but it was likely situated in the vicinity of Mount Nebo, from where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death (Deuteronomy 34:1-4).",

    "longDescription": "Bethphage, meaning \"house of unripe figs\" in Hebrew, was a village located on the Mount of Olives, near Bethany, just east of Jerusalem. It is mentioned in the Synoptic Gospels in connection with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. ¶In Matthew 21:1, Mark 11:1, and Luke 19:29, Jesus and His disciples approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives. It was from Bethphage that Jesus sent two of His disciples to retrieve a donkey and a colt, on which He would ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. ¶The fact that Bethphage is mentioned alongside Bethany suggests that the two villages were in close proximity to each other. Bethany is known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11:1, 38-44). ¶The exact location of Bethphage is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, near the road leading from Jericho to Jerusalem. Its name, \"house of unripe figs,\" may refer to the presence of fig trees in the area or to a local feature associated with the cultivation or processing of figs. ¶Bethphage's significance in the Gospels lies in its role as the starting point for Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which marked the beginning of the events leading up to His crucifixion and resurrection. The village's proximity to Jerusalem and its location on the Mount of Olives, a site of great prophetic and eschatological importance, further underscores its significance in the Gospel narrative.",

    "longDescription": "Beth-rehob, also known as Rehob, was an Aramean city and region located in the north of Israel, near the border with Aram (Syria). It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan and later during the reign of King David. ¶In Numbers 13:21, the spies sent by Moses to explore Canaan are said to have gone as far north as Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. This suggests that Rehob was located in the northernmost part of the Promised Land, close to the entrance of Hamath, a major city in Syria. ¶In Judges 18:28, Rehob is mentioned as a reference point to describe the location of Laish, a city that the Danites conquered and renamed Dan. The text states that Laish was situated near Beth-rehob, indicating the proximity of the two places. ¶During the reign of King David, Beth-rehob played a role in the conflict between Israel and the Ammonites. In 2 Samuel 10:6, the Ammonites, facing an impending attack from David's army, hired Aramean mercenaries from various regions, including Beth-rehob, to help them in battle. The Arameans of Beth-rehob, along with those from Zobah, provided 20,000 foot soldiers to support the Ammonites. ¶In the subsequent battle at Helam (2 Samuel 10:8), the Arameans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, together with the Ammonites, faced David's army, led by Joab and Abishai. The Israelites defeated the Arameans and Ammonites, and the Arameans made peace with Israel, fearing to help the Ammonites any further. ¶The exact location of Beth-rehob is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region of Aram, north of Israel, possibly in the area known as the Beqaa Valley in modern-day Lebanon. Its association with the Arameans and its proximity to Hamath suggest that it was an important city or region in the Aramean kingdom.",

Bethsaida was one of the cities, along with Chorazin and Capernaum, that Jesus rebuked for their unbelief despite the mighty works He had done in their midst (Matthew 11:21, Luke 10:13). After the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, Jesus instructed His disciples to cross over to Bethsaida while He dismissed the crowd (Mark 6:45). The exact location of Bethsaida is debated, but it was likely situated near where the Jordan River enters the Sea of Galilee. Bethsaida's name derives from the Hebrew for \"house of fishing\" or \"house of hunting,\" reflecting its primary industry.

The city was strategically positioned at the junction of the Jezreel and Jordan Valleys, controlling access to the Jezreel Valley from the east. ¶In Joshua 17:11 and 16, Beth-shean is listed among the cities and towns within Manasseh's inheritance that were not fully conquered by the Israelites. The Manassites were unable to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, and the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in the land. ¶Judges 1:27 reiterates that Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth-shean and its villages, and the Canaanites continued to live there. ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Beth-shean was included in the fifth administrative district overseen by Baana, son of Ahilud (1 Kings 4:12). The city's inclusion in this list suggests its ongoing importance and the presence of a significant Israelite population. ¶The most notable event associated with Beth-shean in the Bible is the aftermath of the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines at Mount Gilboa. In 1 Samuel 31:10-12, after Saul and his sons were killed in battle, the Philistines fastened their bodies to the wall of Beth-shean. When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard about this, they travelled through the night, took down the bodies, and buried them in Jabesh. ¶Later, during David's reign, the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan were retrieved from Jabesh-gilead and buried in the tomb of Saul's father, Kish, in Benjamin (2 Samuel 21:12-14). ¶Beth-shean's strategic location made it a target for conquest throughout history. The city was eventually captured by the Egyptians and later by the Assyrians. It was known as Scythopolis during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, serving as the leading city of the Decapolis, a group of ten Hellenistic cities in the region.",

    "longDescription": "Beth-shemesh, meaning \"house of the sun\" in Hebrew, was a city located in the Shephelah region, the western foothills of Judah. It was allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:10) and later given to the Levites of the family of Aaron (Joshua 21:16; 1 Chronicles 6:59). ¶Beth-shemesh is primarily known for its association with the return of the Ark of the Covenant from the Philistines (1 Samuel 6). After the Ark had been captured by the Philistines, they sent it back on a cart, guided by two milk cows. The cows miraculously went straight to Beth-shemesh, where the people were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley (1 Samuel 6:9, 12-13). ¶The men of Beth-shemesh rejoiced when they saw the Ark, offering the cows as a burnt offering and sacrificing to the Lord (1 Samuel 6:14-15). However, some of the men looked inside the Ark, and as a result, God struck down 70 men (some manuscripts say 50,070) for their irreverence (1 Samuel 6:19-20). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Beth-shemesh was included in the second administrative district overseen by Ben-Deker (1 Kings 4:9). ¶Later, during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah, a battle took place between Amaziah and King Jehoash of Israel at Beth-shemesh. Amaziah was defeated and captured by Jehoash, who then proceeded to break down a section of the wall of Jerusalem (2 Kings 14:11-13; 2 Chronicles 25:21-23). ¶In the time of King Ahaz of Judah, the Philistines invaded the cities of the Shephelah, including Beth-shemesh, capturing and occupying them (2 Chronicles 28:18). ¶The city of Beth-shemesh is also mentioned in Judges 1:35, where it is stated that the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. Mount Heres, meaning \"mount of the sun,\" is likely another name for Beth-shemesh or the hill on which it was located.",

In ancient times, the term \"apple\" could have referred to various fruits, such as apricots, quinces, or even citrons. ¶No other information about Beth-tappuah is provided in the Bible, and the town is not mentioned in any other historical or archaeological context. Its inclusion in the list of Judah's towns highlights the extent of the tribe's territory and the variety of settlements within it.",

    "shortDescription": "Beth-togarmah was a region or people group that traded horses and mules with Tyre and was allied with Gog, a future enemy of Israel. (Ezekiel 27:14; 38:6)",
    "longDescription": "Beth-togarmah is mentioned twice in the Book of Ezekiel, both times in the context of prophetic visions concerning the future of Israel and the nations surrounding it. ¶In Ezekiel 27:14, Beth-togarmah is listed among the trading partners of the city of Tyre, a major commercial center on the Mediterranean coast. The people of Beth-togarmah are described as supplying horses, war horses, and mules to the markets of Tyre. This suggests that Beth-togarmah was known for its livestock, particularly horses, and that it had a significant role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network. ¶The exact location of Beth-togarmah is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of Armenia or Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). Some scholars propose that the name \"Beth-togarmah\" may be related to the Anatolian city of Tegarama, known from Hittite texts, or to the Armenian city of Tilgarimmu, mentioned in Assyrian records. ¶In Ezekiel 38:6, Beth-togarmah is mentioned again, this time in the context of a prophetic vision about a future invasion of Israel by a coalition of nations led by Gog, from the land of Magog. Beth-togarmah is described as being \"from the far north,\" along with Gomer and its troops, suggesting a geographical location north of Israel. This prophecy portrays Beth-togarmah as one of the allies of Gog in the latter days, participating in the attack on Israel. ¶The prophecy in Ezekiel 38-39 is often interpreted as a symbolic representation of the final battle between the forces of good and evil, with Gog and its allies representing the nations that oppose God and His people. The ultimate defeat of Gog and its allies, including Beth-togarmah, emphasizes God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph of His kingdom.",

    "longDescription": "Beth-zur, meaning \"house of rock\" or \"house of the wall\" in Hebrew, was a town located in the hill country of Judah, mentioned several times in the Old Testament. It was one of the towns allotted to Judah during the division of the Promised Land (Joshua 15:58). ¶Beth-zur was associated with Maon, as Maon was the father of Beth-zur (1 Chronicles 2:45). This may suggest that Beth-zur was founded by the descendants of Maon or that it was a satellite settlement of Maon. ¶During the reign of King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Beth-zur was one of the cities fortified for the defense of Judah (2 Chronicles 11:7). This fortification was part of Rehoboam's strategy to strengthen his kingdom against potential threats from the northern tribes of Israel and neighboring nations. ¶Later, in the time of Nehemiah, after the return from the Babylonian exile, Beth-zur was one of the towns whose walls were repaired (Nehemiah 3:16). The mention of Beth-zur in this context suggests that it had been inhabited before the exile and was being restored as part of the rebuilding of Judah. ¶The exact location of Beth-zur is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, possibly near the ancient city of Hebron. Its location in the hill country would have made it a strategic point for defense and control of the surrounding area. ¶No other significant events or people are directly associated with Beth-zur in the Bible.",

These prophecies depict Bozrah as a symbol of Edom's power and pride, which would be brought low by God's judgment. ¶Isaiah's prophecy portrays God as a warrior coming from Bozrah with blood-stained garments, symbolizing His vengeance against Edom (Isaiah 63:1-6). Jeremiah foretells that Bozrah would become a desolation and a curse, with its inhabitants fleeing in terror (Jeremiah 49:13, 22). Amos declares that God would send fire upon Bozrah, consuming its palaces (Amos 1:12). ¶The exact location of Bozrah is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the modern town of Busaira in southern Jordan.

The wall's exact location is not specified, but it was likely a significant defensive structure, possibly wider or more substantial than other parts of the wall. ¶Later, during the dedication of the completed wall, two choirs proceeded in opposite directions along the top of the wall. One choir went past the Broad Wall to the Ephraim Gate (Nehemiah 12:38), indicating that the Broad Wall was located in the northern part of the city, possibly near the Temple area. ¶The Broad Wall's construction and repair were part of Nehemiah's efforts to restore Jerusalem's defenses and rebuild the city after the Babylonian exile. Its mention in the Bible highlights the importance of fortifications in ancient cities and the significance of Nehemiah's work in revitalizing Jerusalem.",

The Brook of Egypt is generally identified with the Wadi el-Arish, a seasonal stream that flows into the Mediterranean Sea near the modern border between Israel and Egypt. ¶In Joshua 13:3, Shihor is described as being \"east of Egypt,\" suggesting that it was a separate body of water from the Nile River. However, in Isaiah 23:3, Shihor seems to be associated with the Nile, possibly referring to one of its eastern branches. The Brook of Egypt served not only as a geographical boundary but also as a symbol of the extent of God's promise to Israel and the limit of their conquest. During the reign of King Josiah, the Brook of Egypt was mentioned as the southern limit of Judah's territory (2 Kings 24:7).",

However, when Hiram visited the cities, he was displeased with them and called them \"Cabul,\" which means \"good for nothing\" or \"like nothing.\" ¶The exact location and identity of these cities are not specified in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that they may have been located in the northern part of Israel, near the border with Tyre. The story highlights the relationship between Solomon and Hiram, as well as the exchange of resources and territories between their kingdoms. It also shows that not all gifts or transactions were satisfactory to both parties involved.",

Philip the evangelist settled in Caesarea after baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:40). The apostle Peter visited Caesarea and preached to the Gentile centurion Cornelius, leading to his conversion (Acts 10:1-48). Paul passed through Caesarea on his missionary journeys (Acts 9:30; 18:22) and was later imprisoned there for two years before being sent to Rome for trial (Acts 23:23-26:32). ¶Caesarea was known for its impressive harbor, which was constructed using advanced Roman engineering techniques. The city also featured a temple dedicated to Augustus, an amphitheater, a hippodrome, and a Roman aqueduct. As a center of Roman administration and a hub for trade, Caesarea played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity and the interaction between the Jewish and Gentile believers.",

It was later rebuilt and renamed Caesarea Philippi by Philip the Tetrarch, son of Herod the Great, in honor of himself and the Roman emperor. The city was known for its temple dedicated to Pan and its proximity to a large spring that fed the Jordan River. ¶Jesus' conversation with his disciples at Caesarea Philippi marked a turning point in his ministry. It was here that he began to reveal more openly his identity as the Messiah and his impending death and resurrection (Matthew 16:21; Mark 8:31). The location, with its pagan associations and Gentile population, also symbolized the expanding mission of the gospel beyond the Jewish people.",

It was known for its impressive palaces, temples, and artistic achievements. Archaeological excavations at the site, known today as Nimrud, have uncovered significant remains of the ancient city, including royal inscriptions, reliefs, and statues. ¶In the Bible, Calah is mentioned only in the context of Nimrod's kingdom and the early development of Assyria.

Some scholars identify it with the ancient city of Kullania or Kullanhu, known from Assyrian inscriptions, which was located near the Tigris River. ¶In the Bible, Calneh is mentioned alongside other notable cities such as Babel, Erech, and Accad, suggesting its importance in the ancient Near Eastern world. The prophet Amos used Calneh as an example of a great city that had fallen, warning Israel of impending judgment (Amos 6:2). Similarly, Isaiah mentioned Calneh in the context of Assyria's conquests and its arrogance against God (Isaiah 10:9). ¶Ezekiel's reference to Calneh as a trading partner of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:23) indicates that the city was involved in commercial activities and had established economic ties with other major centers in the region. ¶Although the biblical references to Calneh are brief, they suggest that it was a city of considerable significance in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its political, economic, and cultural importance.

    "longDescription": "Canaan refers to both a region and a people group in the Bible. As a region, Canaan was the ancient name for the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, roughly corresponding to modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Syria and Jordan. It was the land God promised to give to Abraham and his descendants (Genesis 12:5-7; 17:8). ¶The Canaanites were the descendants of Canaan, the grandson of Noah through Ham (Genesis 10:18-19). They were known for their idolatry and wickedness, which led to God commanding the Israelites to drive them out of the land (Deuteronomy 20:17). The term \"Canaanite\" was also used to refer to merchants or traders (Job 41:6; Proverbs 31:24), possibly due to their reputation for trading. ¶After the Exodus, the Israelites conquered parts of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, but they failed to completely drive out the Canaanites (Judges 1:27-36). This led to ongoing conflicts and religious influences throughout Israel's history. The prophets often rebuked Israel for adopting Canaanite practices and worshipping their gods (Ezekiel 16:3).",

Despite the numerous miracles and teachings, the people of Capernaum did not repent, leading Jesus to rebuke the city for its unbelief (Matthew 11:23; Luke 10:15). ¶The ruins of ancient Capernaum have been excavated, revealing the remains of a synagogue dating to the 4th or 5th century AD, built on the foundation of an earlier synagogue from the time of Jesus. The site also includes the remains of a house that may have belonged to Peter.",

This suggests that the Philistines, who are known to have settled in the coastal region of Canaan, trace their ancestry back to Caphtor. ¶In the New Testament, Crete is mentioned several times in connection with the apostle Paul's travels. During his journey to Rome, Paul's ship sailed along the southern coast of Crete (Acts 27:7-13), and they sought to winter in the Cretan harbor of Phoenix (Acts 27:12). After the ship encountered a storm and was wrecked on the island of Malta, Paul continued his journey and eventually passed by Crete again (Acts 27:21). ¶Paul also left his companion Titus on Crete to organize the church and appoint elders in every town (Titus 1:5). In his letter to Titus, Paul quotes a Cretan prophet who described Cretans as \"always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons\" (Titus 1:12), indicating the challenges Titus faced in ministering to the people of Crete. ¶On the day of Pentecost, Cretans were among the people present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:11).",

These believers were likely converts from the Jewish diaspora and Gentile proselytes. ¶Cappadocia was known for its unique geological features, including underground cities and rock-cut churches, many of which were used by early Christians as hiding places during times of persecution. The region played a significant role in the early history of Christianity and was home to several important church fathers, such as Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus.",

In Jeremiah 46:2, the prophet describes the decisive battle at Carchemish between the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar and the Egyptians in 605 BC. The Babylonian victory marked the end of Egyptian influence in the region and the beginning of Babylonian supremacy. ¶Archaeologically, Carchemish has been identified with the modern site of Karkamış in southeastern Turkey. Excavations have revealed a rich history dating back to the Hittite Empire, with the city serving as an important center of trade and military power in the region.",

    "longDescription": "Carmel, also known as Racal, was a town located in the hill country of Judah (Joshua 15:55). It is mentioned several times in the Bible, particularly in relation to David's life. Carmel was the home of Nabal, a wealthy but foolish man who refused to assist David and his men (1 Samuel 25:2-11). Nabal's wife, Abigail, intervened and provided for David's needs, demonstrating her wisdom and resourcefulness (1 Samuel 25:14-35). ¶After Nabal's death, David married Abigail, and she became one of his wives (1 Samuel 25:40-42). Later, when David was fleeing from Saul, he sent his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, to stay in Carmel (1 Samuel 27:3). The town is also mentioned in the list of places that received spoils from David's victory over the Amalekites (1 Samuel 30:29). ¶In the Song of Solomon, the beauty of the bride's head is compared to Mount Carmel (Song of Solomon 7:5), likely referring to the lush vegetation and majesty of the mountain. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and Nahum use Carmel as a symbol of fertility, beauty, and God's judgment (Isaiah 33:9, 35:2; Jeremiah 46:18, 50:19; Amos 1:2, 9:3; Nahum 1:4).",

On Mount Carmel, Elijah challenged the people of Israel to choose between the Lord and Baal, and he demonstrated the power of the true God by calling down fire from heaven. ¶After the contest, Elijah slaughtered the prophets of Baal at the Brook Kishon (1 Kings 18:40) and then went to the top of Mount Carmel to pray for rain, ending a three-year drought (1 Kings 18:42-45). The mountain is also mentioned in 2 Kings 2:25 and 4:25, in connection with the prophet Elisha, who was Elijah's successor. ¶Mount Carmel's lush vegetation and beauty made it a symbol of fertility and God's blessing in the Bible (Isaiah 35:2; Jeremiah 50:19; Amos 9:3). The mountain's strategic location and natural resources also made it a place of military and political significance throughout history.",

At the river Ahava, Ezra discovered that there were no Levites among the returning exiles (Ezra 8:15). ¶Ezra then sent a delegation to Casiphia, where a man named Iddo was the leader, to request that Levites be sent to join the returning group (Ezra 8:17). In response to this request, a number of Levites and temple servants were sent from Casiphia to accompany Ezra and the other exiles to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:18-20). ¶The exact location of Casiphia is unknown, but it was likely a settlement in Babylon where a community of Levites lived during the exile. This passage highlights the importance of the Levites in the restoration of temple worship and the care taken by Ezra to ensure that all the necessary personnel were present for the proper functioning of the temple in Jerusalem.",

This measure was taken to prevent the ship from being run aground on the nearby Syrtis Sands, a notorious sandbar off the coast of North Africa. ¶Cauda is a small island located south of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea.

This vow was likely a Nazirite vow (Numbers 6:1-21), which involved abstaining from cutting one's hair until the vow was completed. Paul's actions at Cenchreae indicate his continued observance of Jewish customs and his commitment to his Jewish heritage. ¶In Romans 16:1-2, Paul commends Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchreae, to the believers in Rome. He describes her as a servant of the church and a benefactor to many, including Paul himself. This passage provides insight into the role of women in the early church and their significant contributions to the spread of the gospel.",

    "longDescription": "Chaldea, also known as Babylonia, was an ancient empire located in southern Mesopotamia, in the region of modern-day Iraq. The Chaldeans were known for their expertise in astrology, astronomy, and other forms of wisdom. In the Bible, the term \"Chaldean\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"Babylonian\" or to refer specifically to astrologers and wise men from Babylon. ¶The Chaldeans played a significant role in the history of Israel, particularly during the Babylonian exile. In 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, conquered Judah and deported many of its inhabitants to Chaldea (2 Kings 24:1-2). The prophet Jeremiah warned the people of Judah about the impending Chaldean invasion and the 70-year exile that would follow (Jeremiah 25:11-12). ¶During the exile, some Jews, such as Daniel and his companions, were chosen to serve in the Chaldean court due to their wisdom and knowledge (Daniel 1:3-4). The Chaldeans are also mentioned in connection with the interpretation of dreams and visions (Daniel 2:2-10; 4:7; 5:7-11). ¶The Chaldeans were also known for their military might and their role in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:1-10). However, the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah foretold the eventual downfall of Chaldea at the hands of the Medes and Persians (Isaiah 13:19; 47:1-5; Jeremiah 50:1-51:64).",

It was there that he saw the vision of the four living creatures and the throne of God (Ezekiel 1:1-28). Later, Ezekiel was transported in visions to Jerusalem, where he witnessed the idolatry and abominations being committed in the temple (Ezekiel 8:1-18). ¶The Chebar River is also mentioned in connection with the elders of Judah who came to consult Ezekiel (Ezekiel 3:15) and the vision of the cherubim and the glory of God departing from the temple (Ezekiel 10:15-22). ¶The exact location of the Chebar River is uncertain, but it was likely a navigable canal or tributary of the Euphrates River. The settlement of Jewish exiles by the river suggests that it was an area suitable for agriculture and sustaining a population. The Chebar River serves as an important geographical marker in Ezekiel's prophecies and provides the setting for many of his visions and messages from God.",

The Gibeonites, fearing destruction by the Israelites, sent ambassadors disguised as travelers from a distant land to seek a covenant of peace. Joshua and the leaders of Israel made a treaty with them without consulting the Lord, only to discover later that the Gibeonites were actually their neighbors. ¶As a result of the treaty, the Gibeonites were spared but were assigned to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and the altar of the Lord (Joshua 9:27). Chephirah, along with the other Gibeonite cities, was initially allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:26) but later became part of the territory of Judah. ¶After the Babylonian exile, the descendants of the Gibeonites, including those from Chephirah, returned to their cities and were counted among the people of Israel (Ezra 2:25; Nehemiah 7:29). The town's mention in these post-exilic records indicates that it was still inhabited and recognized as a distinct community during the Persian period.",

The exact location of the brook is uncertain, but it was likely one of the many wadis or seasonal streams that flowed into the Jordan River from the mountains of Gilead. ¶This event demonstrates God's faithfulness in providing for His servant during a time of hardship and judgment. It also highlights Elijah's obedience and trust in God's direction and provision.

This suggests that during the Babylonian captivity, some Jews may have settled in Cherub and other nearby towns, and over time, their family records were lost or destroyed. ¶The exact location of Cherub is unknown, but it was likely a small town or village in Babylonia, where a community of Jewish exiles had lived during the captivity. The name \"Cherub\" may be derived from the Akkadian word \"kāribu,\" which means \"intercessor\" or \"one who blesses,\" possibly indicating a religious significance of the town in Babylonian culture. ¶The mention of Cherub in the lists of returning exiles highlights the challenges faced by some Jews in proving their heritage and the diversity of locations from which they returned to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.",

It is possible that Chilmad was a city or region in Mesopotamia, as it is mentioned alongside other places in that area, such as Haran and Asshur. ¶The context of the passage suggests that Chilmad was known for its trade and commercial activities, as it is listed among the merchants and suppliers of Tyre. However, the specific goods or products that Chilmad traded are not mentioned in the text. ¶Given the limited information available, Chilmad appears to have been a place of some commercial significance during the time of Ezekiel, but its precise location and role in the ancient Near Eastern trade network remain uncertain.",

    "longDescription": "Chinnereth, Chinneroth, the Sea of Galilee, and the Sea of Tiberias are different names used in the Bible to refer to the largest freshwater lake in Israel. The lake is located in the Jordan Rift Valley, fed by the Jordan River, and is approximately 13 miles (21 kilometers) long and 8 miles (13 kilometers) wide. ¶In the Old Testament, the lake is referred to as the Sea of Chinnereth (Numbers 34:11; Joshua 13:27) or Chinneroth (Joshua 12:3), likely named after a nearby town. The name \"Chinnereth\" may be derived from the Hebrew word for \"harp,\" possibly referring to the shape of the lake. ¶In the New Testament, the lake is most commonly known as the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 4:18; Mark 1:16; John 6:1) and is the setting for many events in Jesus' life and ministry. Jesus called his first disciples, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, while they were fishing on the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 4:18-22). He also calmed a storm on the lake (Mark 4:35-41), walked on its waters (John 6:16-21), and appeared to his disciples on its shores after his resurrection (John 21:1-14). ¶The lake is also referred to as the Sea of Tiberias (John 6:1; 21:1), named after the city of Tiberias, which was founded on its western shore during the reign of Herod Antipas (circa 20 CE). The city was named in honor of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. ¶The Sea of Galilee was an important source of livelihood for the people in the region, with fishing being a major industry. Several of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were fishermen on the lake (Luke 5:1-11). The lake's shores were also dotted with numerous towns and villages, such as Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Magdala, which feature prominently in the Gospels.",

This suggests that Chinnereth was a significant city in the region during the time of the conquest and settlement of Canaan. ¶The Sea of Chinnereth, later known as the Sea of Galilee, was named after the city or region of Chinnereth (Numbers 34:11; Deuteronomy 3:17). This sea played a crucial role in the ministry of Jesus Christ, as he performed many miracles and taught in the towns and villages along its shores. ¶In 1 Kings 15:20, during the reign of King Baasha of Israel, Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, attacked several cities in northern Israel, including \"all Chinneroth,\" referring to the region around the Sea of Galilee. This event demonstrates the strategic importance of the Chinneroth region in the geopolitical landscape of ancient Israel.",

It was known for its strategic location along the shipping routes between Asia Minor and Greece. The island was famous for its wine production and its cultivation of mastic, a resin used for medicinal purposes and as a spice. ¶In Paul's time, Chios was part of the Roman Empire and had a significant Jewish population. The brief mention of Chios in the book of Acts suggests that it was a regular stop for ships navigating the Aegean Sea and that Paul's journey followed the established maritime trade routes of the time. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any further details about Paul's activities or experiences on Chios, the island's inclusion in the account of his journey highlights the geographical scope of his travels and the spread of the early Christian church throughout the Mediterranean world.",

This suggests that Jesus had carried out significant miracles and teachings in Chorazin, yet the people remained unresponsive to his message. ¶Jesus then declares that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for Chorazin, emphasizing the severity of the town's spiritual hardness and the consequences of rejecting the Messiah. ¶The exact location of Chorazin is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be the modern-day site of Khirbet Karazeh, about 2.5 miles north of Capernaum. Archaeological excavations at the site have revealed the remains of a synagogue from the 3rd or 4th century AD, as well as residential buildings and streets. ¶Chorazin serves as a sobering example of the consequences of unbelief and the importance of responding to Jesus' teachings and miracles with faith and repentance.",

Paul was born in Tarsus, one of the chief cities of Cilicia (Acts 21:39; 22:3). After his conversion, Paul spent some time in Cilicia (Galatians 1:21; Acts 9:30) and later revisited the region during his second missionary journey, strengthening the churches (Acts 15:41). ¶Cilicia had a significant Jewish population, and the synagogue of the Cilicians in Jerusalem was among those who disputed with Stephen (Acts 6:9). The early Christian church spread to Cilicia, as evidenced by the letter addressed to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia (Acts 15:23). ¶Geographically, Cilicia was an important region, serving as a major trade route between Syria and the west. The Cilician Gates, a mountain pass through the Taurus Mountains, was a strategic point of travel and was likely used by Paul and Barnabas during their missionary journeys (Acts 15:41).",

It is most notably known as the recipient of one of Paul's epistles, the Letter to the Colossians. ¶In the opening of the epistle (Colossians 1:2), Paul addresses the letter to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colossae. The church in Colossae was likely established during Paul's third missionary journey, as he spent two years teaching in Ephesus, and the gospel spread throughout the region (Acts 19:10). ¶Although Paul had not personally visited Colossae (Colossians 2:1), he had heard about the faith and love of the Colossian believers through Epaphras, who was likely the founder of the church (Colossians 1:7-8). Epaphras had informed Paul of some concerns regarding false teachings that were influencing the Colossian church, prompting Paul to write the epistle. ¶In the letter, Paul emphasizes the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ, warning against false philosophies and human traditions that could lead believers astray (Colossians 2:8-23). He also provides practical instructions for Christian living, including relationships within families and between slaves and masters (Colossians 3:1-4:6). ¶The closing of the letter (Colossians 4:18) includes a personal greeting from Paul, written in his own hand, and a request for the Colossians to exchange letters with the church in Laodicea, another nearby city. ¶Colossae was known for its wool and dye industry, particularly a unique purple dye called colossinus. The city was also located near the important trade routes that connected Ephesus to the Euphrates River. However, by the time of Paul's writing, Colossae had declined in importance compared to the nearby cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis.",

The Pharisees would declare their property or assets as \"Corban,\" meaning it was dedicated to God, and thus exempt from being used to help their parents, even though they could still benefit from it themselves. Jesus condemns this practice as a way of nullifying God's commandment to honor one's father and mother. ¶The term Corban is derived from the Hebrew word \"qorban,\" which means \"offering\" or \"sacrifice.\" In the Old Testament, it refers to various offerings and sacrifices brought to the temple as an act of worship and devotion to God. ¶In Matthew 27:6, the term Corban appears again, this time referring to the temple treasury. After Judas returned the thirty pieces of silver he had received for betraying Jesus, the chief priests decided that it was not lawful to put the money into the treasury (Corban) because it was the price of blood. This indicates that the temple treasury was considered sacred, and there were regulations concerning the source and use of funds placed in it.",

    "longDescription": "Corinth was a prominent city in ancient Greece, located on the Isthmus of Corinth, which connects the Peloponnese to the mainland. It was known for its strategic location, controlling trade routes between the Aegean and Adriatic seas. The city was famous for its wealth, luxury, and immorality. ¶In the New Testament, Corinth plays a significant role as the location of a Christian church founded by the apostle Paul during his second missionary journey (Acts 18:1-18). Paul spent 18 months in Corinth, working as a tentmaker and preaching the gospel. Many Corinthians, including Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed and were baptized (Acts 18:8). ¶After leaving Corinth, Paul wrote two epistles to the church, known as 1 and 2 Corinthians. These letters address various issues faced by the Corinthian believers, including divisions, immorality, lawsuits, and questions about spiritual gifts, resurrection, and Christian conduct. ¶In Romans 16:27, Paul sends greetings to the Corinthians, indicating that he wrote the epistle to the Romans while in Corinth. In 2 Timothy 4:20, Paul mentions that he left Erastus in Corinth, suggesting that the city continued to have a Christian presence. ¶Throughout the epistles, Paul refers to the Corinthian believers with affection, calling them \"saints\" (1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Corinthians 1:1) and expressing his love for them (2 Corinthians 6:11; 13:13-14). The correspondence between Paul and the Corinthian church provides valuable insights into the challenges and growth of the early Christian community in a significant Gentile city.",

It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in connection with repairs made to the city's fortifications and measurements of the city's perimeter. ¶In 2 Kings 14:13 and 2 Chronicles 25:23, the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the points from which King Jehoash of Israel broke down the wall of Jerusalem after defeating King Amaziah of Judah. This suggests that the Corner Gate was a significant and strategic point in the city's defenses. ¶During the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, the Corner Gate was fortified and towers were built near it (2 Chronicles 26:9). This further emphasizes the gate's importance in the city's defensive structure. ¶In the book of Jeremiah, the Corner Gate is mentioned as one of the landmarks in the prophetic description of Jerusalem's future restoration (Jeremiah 31:38). This passage envisions a time when the city will be rebuilt and expanded, with the Corner Gate marking one of the boundaries of the renewed city. ¶The exact location of the Corner Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated at a point where the city wall turned a corner, hence its name. Some scholars suggest that it may have been located near the northwest corner of the city, possibly close to the present-day Jaffa Gate.",

The next day, they went to Rhodes and from there to Patara. This brief mention of Cos provides insight into the route taken by Paul and his companions as they navigated the islands of the Aegean Sea. ¶Cos was known in ancient times for its strategic location, fertile land, and medical school associated with Hippocrates, the famous Greek physician. The island was also a center of the worship of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. ¶Although the Bible does not provide any details about Paul's activities or experiences on Cos, the mention of the island in the context of his journey demonstrates the apostle's determination to return to Jerusalem, despite the warnings he had received about the hardships that awaited him there (Acts 20:22-23; 21:4, 11-14). The inclusion of Cos in the itinerary also highlights the extensive travel and maritime connections in the ancient Mediterranean world, which facilitated the spread of the gospel.",

Some scholars suggest that Cushan might be related to Cush, the ancient region in Africa, due to the similarity in names. Others propose that it could be a reference to a Midianite tribe or another unidentified location. ¶Given the limited information available, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about Cushan. However, its mention alongside Midian in the context of God's judgment suggests that it may have been a place or people group that experienced divine punishment or was affected by the events described in Habakkuk's vision.",

    "longDescription": "Cuthah, also known as Cuth, was a city in Babylonia from which the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V (or possibly Sargon II) brought people to settle in the cities of Samaria after the deportation of the Israelites (2 Kings 17:24). This event occurred around 722 BC when the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and exiled a significant portion of its population. ¶The people of Cuthah, along with those from other Babylonian cities such as Babylon, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, were relocated to Samaria. These settlers, who came to be known as the Samaritans, initially did not worship the Lord and instead continued to serve their own gods (2 Kings 17:29-31). ¶In response to the settlers' lack of reverence for the Lord, God sent lions among them, which killed some of the people. When the king of Assyria was informed of this, he ordered that one of the priests from among the exiled Israelites be sent back to Samaria to teach the new inhabitants about the God of the land (2 Kings 17:25-28). ¶As a result, the Samaritans developed a syncretic religion, combining elements of their own beliefs with the worship of the Lord (2 Kings 17:32-34, 41). This mixed religious practice led to ongoing tensions between the Samaritans and the Jews who returned from the Babylonian exile, as evidenced in the New Testament (e.g., John 4:9). ¶The mention of Cuthah in the Bible provides insight into the complex history of the Samaritan people and the religious and cultural dynamics that shaped the region after the Assyrian conquest of Israel.",

In the Old Testament, the island is mentioned in the context of trade and prophecy. Isaiah 23:1, 12 and Jeremiah 2:10 refer to the ships of Kittim, indicating the island's involvement in maritime trade. Ezekiel 27:6 mentions the use of ivory from the coasts of Elishah (possibly Cyprus) in the construction of ships. ¶In Numbers 24:24 and Daniel 11:30, Kittim is associated with ships that come against the people of God, possibly referring to the island's role in military campaigns or as a base for hostile forces. ¶In the New Testament, Cyprus plays a significant role in the spread of early Christianity. The apostle Barnabas, a Levite from Cyprus (Acts 4:36), and some unnamed believers from the island were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Antioch (Acts 11:19-20). Barnabas and Saul (Paul) visited Cyprus during their first missionary journey (Acts 13:4), where they encountered the sorcerer Elymas and converted the proconsul Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:6-12). ¶Later, Barnabas and Mark sailed to Cyprus after a disagreement with Paul (Acts 15:39). Paul also visited the island during his third missionary journey (Acts 21:3) and during his journey to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27:4). ¶The early Christian community in Cyprus included Mnason, an early disciple who provided lodging for Paul and his companions in Jerusalem (Acts 21:16).",

In the New Testament, Cyrene is mentioned in connection with several individuals who played a role in the life of Jesus and the early Christian church. ¶Simon of Cyrene, who was compelled by Roman soldiers to carry Jesus' cross on the way to His crucifixion, is mentioned in Matthew 27:32, Mark 15:21, and Luke 23:26. Mark's Gospel identifies Simon as the father of Alexander and Rufus, suggesting that these men may have been known to the early Christian community. ¶In Acts 2:10, Cyrenians are listed among the people present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples. Some of these Cyrenian Jews, along with those from Cyprus, were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Antioch (Acts 11:20). ¶Lucius of Cyrene is mentioned as one of the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch who ministered to the Lord and fasted, leading to the commissioning of Barnabas and Saul (Paul) for their first missionary journey (Acts 13:1). ¶In Acts 6:9, Cyrenian Jews are mentioned as part of the Synagogue of the Freedmen, which disputed with Stephen, the first Christian martyr. ¶These references to Cyrene in the New Testament highlight the city's significance as a center of Jewish diaspora and its contribution to the spread of early Christianity, particularly in the evangelization of Gentiles.",

This indicates that Daberath, or a portion of it, was set apart for the Levites, who were responsible for assisting the priests in the tabernacle service and teaching the law to the people. ¶The exact location of Daberath is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally identified with the modern village of Daburiyya, located at the base of Mount Tabor in Lower Galilee. This identification is supported by the similarity in name and the geographical context provided by the biblical references. ¶Apart from its designation as a Levitical city and its location on the border of Issachar's territory, no other details are provided about Daberath in the Bible.

The city was known for its beauty and prosperity, with references to its fertile gardens and bustling trade (Song of Solomon 7:4; Ezekiel 27:18). In the New Testament, Damascus is significant as the place of Paul's conversion on the road to the city (Acts 9:1-19).

The tribe was allotted territory in the northern part of Canaan (Joshua 19:40-48). The city of Dan, originally known as Laish or Leshem, was conquered by the Danites (Joshua 19:47; Judges 18:29). It became the northernmost city of Israel, often used in the phrase \"from Dan to Beersheba\" to describe the entire land (Judges 20:1; 1 Samuel 3:20). Jeroboam set up one of his golden calves in Dan (1 Kings 12:29-30), leading to idolatry. The city was also known for its skilled craftsmen (2 Chronicles 2:14). Dan was one of the first places to fall to foreign invaders due to its northern location (Jeremiah 4:15; 8:16).",

It stood opposite Mount Gerizim, forming the valley where the city of Shechem was situated. Mount Ebal held significant religious and historical importance for the Israelites. Prior to entering the Promised Land, Moses instructed the Israelites to conduct a ceremony on Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, pronouncing curses from Mount Ebal and blessings from Mount Gerizim (Deuteronomy 11:29; 27:4, 13). After the conquest of Canaan, Joshua led the Israelites in fulfilling this command, building an altar on Mount Ebal and conducting the ceremony as prescribed (Joshua 8:30, 33). In the time of Abimelech, Mount Zalmon (another name for Mount Ebal) was the site where he and his men cut down branches to set fire to the tower of Shechem (Judges 9:48). The mountain is also mentioned in poetic and prophetic texts, such as Psalm 68:14 and Jeremiah 4:15, which refer to Mount Zalmon and Mount Ephraim respectively, likely alluding to the same location as Mount Ebal.",

The Ark was eventually returned, and Samuel led the Israelites in a ceremony of repentance at Mizpah. When the Philistines attacked again, God intervened on behalf of Israel, causing confusion among the Philistines and leading to their defeat (1 Samuel 7:7-11). To commemorate this divine intervention and victory, Samuel set up the stone and named it Ebenezer, acknowledging God's help and deliverance (1 Samuel 7:12). The stone served as a reminder to the Israelites of God's faithfulness and power in their battles against their enemies.",

This discovery provided crucial evidence and support for the Jews in their efforts to restore the Temple and re-establish their religious practices in Jerusalem.

After Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:23-24). Cherubim and a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden to guard the way to the tree of life (Genesis 3:24).

During the Exodus, Edom refused to let the Israelites pass through their territory. Edom was later defeated by King Saul and subjugated under King David. However, they rebelled in later years and were able to establish their independence from Judah. ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos and Obadiah all prophesied against Edom for its arrogance and for standing by when Judah was invaded by Babylon. Edom helped the Babylonians loot Jerusalem and expressed joy over its destruction. As a result, the prophets declared that Edom would face God's wrath and be completely destroyed.",

Later, Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt but rose to power as a trusted official of Pharaoh. During a famine, Israel (or 'Jacob') and his family settled in Egypt with Joseph. ¶After generations passed, the Israelites were enslaved by the Egyptians (Exodus 1:8-14). God called Moses to deliver His people from bondage. After Pharaoh refused to free the Israelites, God sent ten plagues upon Egypt (Exodus 7-12). Finally, Pharaoh relented and the Israelites left in the Exodus. At the Red Sea, God miraculously allowed the Israelites to cross on dry ground but destroyed the pursuing Egyptian army (Exodus 14). ¶Egypt is often used in the Bible as a symbol of bondage and oppression. The prophets warned against trusting in Egypt's power instead of God (Isaiah 30:1-3, 31:1). Yet Egypt was also a place of refuge, as when Mary, Joseph and Jesus fled there to escape Herod (Matthew 2:13-15).",

However, God afflicted the Ekronites with tumors, so they sent the Ark back to Israel (1 Samuel 6). Later, David killed Goliath, and the Israelites pursued the Philistines as far as Ekron (1 Samuel 17:52). ¶The prophets Amos (1:8), Zephaniah (2:4), and Zechariah (9:5,7) all foretold Ekron's destruction as part of God's judgment on the Philistines. King Ahaziah of Israel sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, regarding his illness, showing the city's religious influence (2 Kings 1:2-3,16).",

With a sling and a stone, David struck down Goliath, and the Philistines fled in defeat. ¶After this victory, the Elah Valley became famous as the site of David's triumph and the place where he launched his ascent to the throne. The \"sword of Goliath\" that David took from the fallen giant was kept in Nob, and David later retrieved it when fleeing from Saul (1 Samuel 21:9).",

Elamite kings are mentioned in Assyrian records of campaigns against Judah. The prophets Isaiah (11:11, 21:2, 22:6) and Jeremiah (25:25, 49:34-39) foretold Elam's conquest by the Babylonians and Medes as part of God's judgment. ¶However, Jeremiah also prophesied Elam's restoration in the latter days (49:39). Some Elamites were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9). Nehemiah's opponents included a man named Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab (Nehemiah 2:19, 6:1), possibly indicating alliances between Elam and Israel's neighbors.

King Uzziah of Judah rebuilt and fortified Elath, restoring it to Judah (2 Kings 14:22, 2 Chronicles 26:2). However, during the reign of Ahaz, the Edomites regained control of Elath and drove out the Judeans (2 Kings 16:6). The city later fell under Assyrian and Babylonian control.

Elim's abundant water and shade would have been a welcome relief after this trial. ¶Elim is also mentioned in the list of Israel's journey stages in Numbers 33:9-10.

Another theory is that Elkosh was actually in Assyria, and that Nahum lived among the exiles there. However, the content of Nahum's prophecy, with its focus on Judah's deliverance from Assyrian oppression, makes a Judean location more likely. ¶Regardless of its exact location, Elkosh was significant as the birthplace of one of God's prophets who declared His judgment against a powerful enemy nation and His mercy toward His people.",

In response, Chedorlaomer and his allies, including Arioch of Ellasar, went to war against them in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea/Dead Sea region). The cities of the plain were defeated, and Sodom and Gomorrah were plundered. Lot, Abraham's nephew living in Sodom, was taken captive. ¶When Abraham heard of Lot's capture, he pursued Chedorlaomer's forces with his 318 trained men and defeated them near Damascus, rescuing Lot and recovering the goods and people taken from Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 14:13-16). ¶The exact location of Ellasar is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the region of Mesopotamia, possibly associated with the ancient city of Larsa in southern Babylonia. Its mention in Genesis 14 reveals the geopolitical context of Abraham's time, with rivalries and alliances among the city-states and kingdoms of the ancient Near East.",

After the death of her husband, Tamar was denied the opportunity to marry Judah's youngest son, Shelah, as was customary. Determined to secure her rights and conceive a child, Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and sat at the entrance to Enaim. Judah, not recognizing her, slept with her, and she conceived twin sons, Perez and Zerah (Gen. 38:27-30). When Judah later sought to find the supposed prostitute, he was told that there was no cult prostitute in Enaim (Gen. 38:21-22). The events at Enaim highlight the complex social and moral dynamics of the patriarchal period and the importance of securing one's lineage and rights within the family structure.",

Desperate for guidance, Saul disguised himself and visited the medium, requesting her to conjure up the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel. The medium succeeded, and Samuel's spirit informed Saul that he and his sons would die in battle the next day. ¶Psalm 83:10 mentions En-dor in the context of a prayer for God's judgment against Israel's enemies, referring to the defeat of Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River near En-dor (Judges 4-5).

It was in the wilderness of Engedi that David had the opportunity to kill Saul but chose to spare his life, cutting off a corner of Saul's robe instead (1 Samuel 24:1-7). ¶The Song of Solomon mentions Engedi as a source of fragrant henna blossoms (Song of Solomon 1:14), testifying to its fertility and beauty. In Ezekiel's vision of the restored land of Israel, Engedi is mentioned as a place where fishermen will spread their nets, symbolizing abundance and prosperity (Ezekiel 47:10). ¶The name Engedi means \"spring of the kid (young goat)\" or \"fountain of the goat,\" likely referring to the freshwater springs that make the area an oasis in the desert.

    "longDescription": "En-rogel, also known as the Stone of Zoheleth, was a spring located near Jerusalem, on the border between the territories of Judah and Benjamin (Joshua 15:7; 18:16). It played a significant role in two events related to the succession of King David's throne. ¶First, Adonijah, one of David's sons, attempted to establish himself as king at En-rogel without David's knowledge or consent (1 Kings 1:9). Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Stone of Zoheleth, which was near En-rogel, and invited his brothers and the king's officials to support his claim to the throne. However, his attempt was thwarted when the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba informed David of the situation, leading to Solomon being anointed as king (1 Kings 1:11-40). ¶Later, during Absalom's rebellion against David, En-rogel served as a meeting place for David's supporters, Jonathan and Ahimaaz (2 Samuel 17:17). They would bring information from the city to David, who had fled from Jerusalem. A servant girl would go and tell them the information, and they would then go and tell King David, to avoid being seen entering the city. ¶The name En-rogel means \"spring of the fuller\" or \"fountain of the treader,\" possibly referring to the presence of a water source used for washing or treading clothes. Its exact location is debated, but it is believed to be either the modern-day Bir Ayub (Job's Well) or the Virgin's Spring (Gihon Spring) in the Kidron Valley, south of the City of David.",

In Joshua 18:17, it is mentioned again as part of the southern border of Benjamin, along with Geliloth and the stone of Bohan. ¶The exact location of En-shemesh is uncertain, but it was likely situated east of Jerusalem, in the vicinity of the Kidron Valley. Its name, \"spring of the sun,\" may suggest that it was located in a sunny spot or that it had some association with sun worship in Canaanite times. ¶Apart from its role in demarcating the tribal boundaries, no other details about En-shemesh are provided in the Bible.

This suggests that Ephah was an Arabian tribe known for their camel herds and their involvement in the caravan trade. ¶The name Ephah is associated with the Midianites, as one of Abraham's sons by his concubine Keturah was named Ephah (Genesis 25:4). However, it is unclear whether the Ephah mentioned in Isaiah's prophecy is directly related to this individual or simply shares the same name. ¶Isaiah's prophecy portrays a future time when the wealth of the nations, including that of the Arabian tribes like Ephah, will be brought to Jerusalem in recognition of the Lord's glory and the significance of His people.

It was the site of the famous confrontation between David and the Philistine giant Goliath. ¶The Philistines had gathered their forces at Ephes-dammim, while Saul and the men of Israel were encamped in the Valley of Elah. Goliath, a champion from Gath, emerged from the Philistine camp and challenged the Israelites to send out a warrior to face him in single combat (1 Samuel 17:4-10). ¶David, who had come to the Israelite camp to bring supplies to his brothers, accepted Goliath's challenge. With a sling and a stone, David defeated Goliath, leading to a great victory for the Israelites over the Philistines (1 Samuel 17:48-53). ¶The alternate name Pas-dammim, used in 1 Chronicles 11:13, may be a variant spelling or a scribal error. The exact location of Ephes-dammim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Shephelah, the foothills between the coastal plain and the Judean mountains, where many battles between the Israelites and Philistines took place.",

    "longDescription": "Ephesus was an ancient Greek city located on the western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). It was one of the largest and most important cities in the Roman province of Asia and played a significant role in the early spread of Christianity. ¶The apostle Paul visited Ephesus during his second and third missionary journeys (Acts 18:19-21; 19:1-41). During his third journey, Paul stayed in Ephesus for over two years, preaching the gospel and establishing a strong Christian community (Acts 19:8-10). Many Ephesians turned from their pagan practices and embraced the faith, which led to a decline in the sale of silver shrines of the goddess Artemis (Diana), causing a riot instigated by the silversmiths (Acts 19:23-41). ¶Paul later wrote the Epistle to the Ephesians, one of his prison epistles, to strengthen and encourage the believers in Ephesus (Ephesians 1:1). In this letter, Paul expounds on the nature of the church, the unity of believers in Christ, and the importance of living a life worthy of the calling they had received. ¶Ephesus was also one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 1:11; 2:1-7). In the message to the church in Ephesus, the risen Christ commends their hard work and perseverance but admonishes them for having forsaken their first love and calls them to repent and return to their former devotion. ¶The city was famous for its Temple of Artemis (Diana), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (Acts 19:35). It was also an important center of learning, with a renowned library. Today, the ruins of Ephesus, including the remains of the theater where the riot took place (Acts 19:29), are a popular tourist attraction and a testament to the city's rich history and its role in the early Christian church.",

This action was likely meant to humiliate Judah and demonstrate Israel's military superiority. ¶The Ephraim Gate was probably located on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim.

The public reading of the Law was an important event in the spiritual renewal of the Jewish community after their return from exile. ¶Nehemiah 12:39 describes a dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall, during which two processions of singers and musicians marched along the top of the wall in opposite directions, meeting at the Ephraim Gate before proceeding to the Temple. ¶The Ephraim Gate's location is not specified, but it was likely on the north side of the city, facing toward the territory of Ephraim.

Similarly, Joshua 18:15 describes the southern border of Benjamin, which ran from Kiriath-jearim to Mount Ephron and then turned northward. ¶The exact location of Mount Ephron is uncertain, but based on the biblical description, it was likely situated in the hill country west of Jerusalem, near the modern-day city of Abu Ghosh or Qaryat el-Inab. The mountain's name, Ephron, may be derived from a Canaanite personal name or could be related to the Hebrew word \"epher,\" meaning \"gazelle.\" ¶The mention of Mount Ephron in the border descriptions helps to delineate the territories of Judah and Benjamin and provides insight into the geographical landscape of the region during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan.",

Nimrod, a mighty hunter and ruler, is described as establishing a powerful kingdom that included the cities of Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. ¶Ezra 4:9 mentions the people of Erech among those who wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes of Persia, opposing the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple and the city walls after the Babylonian exile. This suggests that inhabitants of Erech were among those deported and resettled in other parts of the Persian Empire, and they sought to hinder the Jewish returnees' efforts to reestablish their homeland. ¶Archaeologically, Erech is one of the oldest cities in Mesopotamia, with evidence of continuous habitation from the 5th millennium BC. It was an important center of Sumerian culture and religion, known for its impressive ziggurats and the Gilgamesh Epic, one of the earliest known works of literature. ¶The biblical mentions of Erech, though brief, attest to its significance as an ancient Mesopotamian city and its interaction with the history and people of Israel, both in the early stages of civilization and during the post-exilic period.",

The Edomites had rejoiced over Judah's destruction and had even participated in looting the city and capturing fleeing Israelites (Obadiah 1:11-14). ¶Obadiah prophesies that God will bring down the \"wise men\" and \"mighty men\" of Edom, and that their mountain stronghold will be unable to protect them from divine judgment (Obadiah 1:8-9). He also foretells that the house of Israel (or 'Jacob') and Joseph will possess the territories of Edom and the surrounding nations, and that deliverers will come from Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau (Obadiah 1:19, 21). ¶The reference to Mount Esau symbolizes the pride and security of the Edomites in their mountainous territory, as well as their opposition to God's people.",

They also gathered pomegranates and figs from the area (Numbers 13:23). The bountiful produce of the valley was used as evidence of the land's fertility when the spies reported back to Moses and the Israelites (Numbers 13:27). ¶However, despite the Eshcol Valley's fruitfulness, the spies' report also emphasized the strength of the Canaanite inhabitants and their fortified cities, which led to fear and rebellion among the Israelites (Numbers 13:28-33; 14:1-4). As a result, God condemned the unbelieving generation to wander in the wilderness for forty years (Numbers 14:26-35). ¶The Eshcol Valley is also mentioned in Deuteronomy 1:24, recounting the spies' journey, and in Numbers 32:9, where it is referred to as a symbol of the Promised Land's abundance.

It was initially allotted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:33) but was later assigned to the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:41). ¶Eshtaol is particularly associated with the story of Samson, the legendary Israelite judge. Samson was born in the nearby town of Zorah and is described as moving between Zorah and Eshtaol, where the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him (Judges 13:25). After Samson's death, he was buried between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father, Manoah (Judges 16:31). ¶Eshtaol also played a role in the Danite migration narrative. Due to limited territory and pressure from the Philistines, a group of Danites sent spies from Zorah and Eshtaol to search for a new land to settle (Judges 18:2). After the spies returned with a favorable report, six hundred men from the clan of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol to conquer the city of Laish in the north (Judges 18:8, 11). ¶The descendants of the Eshtaolites, a clan from Eshtaol, are mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:53 among the descendants of Judah's son Shobal. This suggests that the city maintained its ties to the tribe of Judah even after being allotted to Dan.",

Later, in 1 Chronicles 4:19, the sons of Ezrah are listed, including Eshtemoa. ¶During the time of David, when he was hiding from King Saul in the wilderness of Judah, David sent some of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites to the elders of Eshtemoa, among other cities (1 Samuel 30:28). This act of sharing the spoils was likely a gesture of goodwill and a way to strengthen alliances with the cities that had supported him. ¶The exact location of Eshtemoa is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of the hill country of Judah, possibly near the modern-day village of es-Semu'a, about 15 kilometers south of Hebron. As a Levitical city, Eshtemoa would have played a role in the religious life of the surrounding region, with the Levites serving as teachers, judges, and spiritual leaders.",

In Joshua 15:42, Ether is mentioned alongside Libnah, Ashan, and Ashnah, while in Joshua 19:7, it is listed with Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen as part of Simeon's inheritance. ¶No other details about Ether are provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown. The Shephelah was known for its fertile soil and served as a buffer zone between the Israelites and the Philistines, who occupied the coastal plain. ¶The mention of Ether in the lists of cities allotted to Judah and Simeon helps to define the extent of their territories and provides insight into the geography of the region during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan.",

It is often referred to simply as \"the River\" or \"Shibolet\" (meaning \"ear of grain\") in Hebrew. ¶In the Garden of Eden narrative, the Euphrates is one of the four rivers that flowed from the garden (Genesis 2:14). Later, it is mentioned as part of the boundary of the Promised Land, as God promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates (Genesis 15:18; Deuteronomy 1:7; 11:24; Joshua 1:4). ¶The Euphrates served as a natural boundary between the Assyrian and Babylonian empires and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It was the site of several significant events, such as the battle of Carchemish, where the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians (Jeremiah 46:2), and the place where Jeremiah hid a linen belt as a symbol of God's judgment on Judah (Jeremiah 13:4-7). ¶In the book of Revelation, the Euphrates is mentioned in connection with the sixth trumpet judgment (Revelation 9:14) and the sixth bowl judgment (Revelation 16:12), where the river is dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east. ¶Throughout the Bible, the Euphrates is used as a symbol of the extent of God's promised blessings (Psalm 72:8), the reach of Israel's enemies (Isaiah 7:20; 8:7), and the future restoration of Israel (Isaiah 11:15; 27:12; Micah 7:12; Zechariah 9:10). ¶The Euphrates played a significant role in the history and commerce of the ancient Near East, with many important cities and civilizations situated along its banks, such as Babylon, Ur, and Carchemish. It was a vital source of water for irrigation and transportation, and its fertile floodplains supported agriculture and trade.",

The name \"Ezel\" may be derived from the Hebrew word \"azel,\" meaning \"departure\" or \"going away,\" possibly referring to David's intended departure from Saul's court. ¶In the context of the narrative, David had become aware of Saul's intention to harm him and sought Jonathan's help to determine the king's true intentions. Jonathan devised a plan to shoot arrows near the Stone of Ezel as a signal to David. If Jonathan told his servant that the arrows were on the near side of the stone, it would indicate that David was safe to return. However, if Jonathan said that the arrows were beyond the stone, it would mean that David should flee for his life (1 Samuel 20:20-22). ¶The exact location of the Stone of Ezel is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated in a field near Gibeah, Saul's hometown, where David and Jonathan could meet without arousing suspicion. The stone may have served as a boundary marker or a prominent landmark that could be easily identified. ¶The Stone of Ezel incident demonstrates the deep friendship between David and Jonathan and their loyalty to each other, even in the face of Saul's hostility. It also showcases their trust in God and their willingness to communicate and act in wisdom to protect David's life.",

It was located near Elath, at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the modern-day country of Jordan. ¶During Solomon's reign, Ezion-geber became a major port city and a center for maritime trade. Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which sailed to Ophir and brought back gold, silver, and other precious materials (1 Kings 9:26-28; 2 Chronicles 8:17-18). The strategic location of Ezion-geber allowed Solomon to establish trade routes with Arabia, East Africa, and possibly even India. ¶Later, during the reign of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, there was an attempt to revive the maritime trade from Ezion-geber.",

After passing Cape Salmone, they arrived at Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea (Acts 27:8). ¶While at Fair Havens, Paul advised the crew to spend the winter there, as he foresaw that continuing the voyage would result in damage and loss (Acts 27:9-10). However, the centurion in charge of the ship decided to follow the advice of the pilot and the ship's owner, who wanted to reach Phoenix, another harbor on Crete, to spend the winter (Acts 27:11-12). ¶The exact location of Fair Havens is believed to be near the modern-day village of Kaloi Limenes, which bears the same name as the ancient harbor. Archaeological evidence, including anchors and other maritime artifacts, has been found in the area, supporting the identification of this site as the Fair Havens mentioned in the Bible.",

It is believed to have been located on the northern side of the city, possibly near the present-day Damascus Gate. ¶In Nehemiah 3:3, during the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall after the Babylonian exile, the Fish Gate was repaired by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place. The Fish Gate is also mentioned in Nehemiah 12:39, where it is listed among the gates that the procession of dedication passed through during the celebration of the completed wall. ¶The name \"Fish Gate\" suggests that it may have been a location where fish were sold or where fishermen entered the city to sell their catch. It is possible that the gate was named after the nearby fish market or the road leading to the Mediterranean Sea, where fish were brought into the city. ¶In Zephaniah 1:10, the Fish Gate is mentioned in a prophecy of judgment against Jerusalem, where the Lord declares that a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, along with wailing from the Second Quarter and a loud crash from the hills. This passage indicates that the Fish Gate was a significant location within the city and that its destruction would be a sign of God's judgment. ¶The rebuilding of the Fish Gate during Nehemiah's time was part of the larger effort to restore Jerusalem and its walls after the Babylonian exile. The participation of the sons of Hassenaah in repairing this gate demonstrates the community's involvement in the rebuilding process and the importance of each section of the wall being restored by different families and groups.",

This battle took place during Absalom's rebellion against his father, which had forced David to flee from Jerusalem. ¶David's army, led by Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, met Absalom's forces in the Forest of Ephraim. The battle spread out over the countryside, and the forest claimed more lives than the sword (2 Samuel 18:8). David's men defeated Absalom's army, and Absalom himself was killed when his hair got caught in the branches of a tree, and Joab thrust three javelins into his heart (2 Samuel 18:9-15). ¶The exact location of the Forest of Ephraim is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars believe that it may have been situated east of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead, where the tribe of Ephraim had some land allotted to them (Joshua 17:15-18). Others suggest that it could have been a forested area within the territory of Ephraim, west of the Jordan. ¶The significance of the Forest of Ephraim lies in its role as the setting for the decisive battle that ended Absalom's rebellion and restored David to the throne. The dense forest terrain likely contributed to the high number of casualties and the difficulty in pursuing the retreating enemy forces.",

    "longDescription": "The Forum of Appius, also known as Appii Forum, is mentioned in Acts 28:15 as one of the places where Christians from Rome came to meet the apostle Paul as he was being brought to the city as a prisoner. The Forum of Appius was a market town located along the Appian Way, the main road connecting Rome to southern Italy. ¶According to the narrative in Acts, after Paul had appealed to Caesar and was sent to Rome, he was permitted to stay by himself with a soldier guarding him (Acts 28:16). As Paul approached the city, believers from Rome traveled to meet him at two locations: the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns (Acts 28:15). ¶The Forum of Appius was situated about 43 miles (69 kilometers) southeast of Rome and was a popular stopping point for travelers. It was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who initiated the construction of the Appian Way in 312 BC. The town likely served as a marketplace and resting place for those journeying along the road. ¶The fact that Christians from Rome came to meet Paul at the Forum of Appius demonstrates the strong support and eagerness of the Roman believers to welcome and encourage the apostle. This meeting would have provided Paul with much-needed fellowship and reassurance as he faced the challenges of his impending trial before Caesar. ¶The mention of the Forum of Appius in the biblical account of Paul's journey to Rome provides insight into the spread of Christianity and the connections between believers in different parts of the Roman Empire. It also highlights the importance of the Appian Way as a major transportation route and the role of market towns like the Forum of Appius in facilitating travel and communication in the ancient world.",

It is believed to have been located on the southeastern side of the city, possibly near the Pool of Siloam or the King's Garden. ¶In Nehemiah 2:14, during Nehemiah's nighttime inspection of the city's walls, he passed by the Fountain Gate and noted its state of disrepair. Later, in Nehemiah 3:15, Shallun, the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah, is recorded as having repaired the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it, covered it, and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place. Additionally, he repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah (Siloam) by the King's Garden, as far as the stairs that went down from the City of David. ¶The Fountain Gate is also mentioned in Nehemiah 12:37, where it is described as a location along the route of the procession of dedication for the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. The procession, led by Ezra and Nehemiah, started at the Fountain Gate and proceeded to the Water Gate, then to the Sheep Gate, and finally to the Temple. ¶The name \"Fountain Gate\" suggests that it may have been located near a water source, possibly the Gihon Spring or the Pool of Siloam, which were important for Jerusalem's water supply. Its proximity to the King's Garden also indicates that it was in an area of the city associated with royalty and agriculture. ¶The rebuilding of the Fountain Gate during Nehemiah's time was part of the larger effort to restore Jerusalem and its walls after the Babylonian exile. The participation of Shallun in repairing this gate demonstrates the community's involvement in the rebuilding process and the importance of each section of the wall being restored by different individuals and groups.",

It is most notably associated with Joshua, the successor of Moses and the leader of the Israelites during the conquest of the Promised Land. ¶According to Joshua 24:30 and Judges 2:9, after Joshua had led the Israelites into Canaan and divided the land among the tribes, he died at the age of 110 and was buried in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. ¶The specific location of Mount Gaash is not clearly identified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated in the vicinity of Timnath-serah, which is thought to be modern-day Khirbet Tibnah, located approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Shechem. ¶In addition to being the burial place of Joshua, Mount Gaash is also mentioned in connection with two of David's mighty men. In 2 Samuel 23:30 and 1 Chronicles 11:32, Hiddai (or Hurai) of the brooks of Gaash is listed among the elite warriors who fought alongside David. This suggests that the region around Mount Gaash was known for its brave and skilled fighters. ¶The mention of Mount Gaash in the Bible serves to underscore the importance of Joshua as a key figure in Israel's history and his significant role in leading the people into the Promised Land. The association of this location with Joshua's burial place and the homeland of some of David's mighty men highlights the enduring legacy of faith and courage that these individuals embodied.",

    "longDescription": "Gabbatha, also known as the Stone Pavement, is mentioned in John 19:13 as the location where Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, sat in judgment over Jesus during his trial. The Gospel of John provides this detail as part of the narrative of Jesus' passion and crucifixion. ¶According to John's account, after Pilate had questioned Jesus and found no guilt in him, he brought Jesus out to the Jews and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called \"The Stone Pavement,\" which in Aramaic is \"Gabbatha.\" This event took place around the sixth hour on the day of Preparation for the Passover. ¶The term \"Gabbatha\" is an Aramaic word that means \"elevated place\" or \"platform.\" The Stone Pavement, or Lithostrotos in Greek, refers to a raised, paved area, possibly adorned with mosaic or stone tiles. This platform was likely located in the open courtyard of Herod's palace in Jerusalem, where the Roman governor would conduct official business and pronounce judgments. ¶The mention of Gabbatha in the context of Jesus' trial highlights the political and judicial aspects of the proceedings. Pilate, as the Roman governor, represented the authority of the Roman Empire, and his seating on the judgment seat at Gabbatha underscores the official nature of the trial and the verdict he would render. ¶The specific location of Gabbatha within Jerusalem is not conclusively known, but it is believed to have been near the present-day Antonia Fortress, north of the Temple Mount. Archaeological excavations in the area have uncovered remains of a large, paved courtyard that may have been the Stone Pavement mentioned in the Gospel of John. ¶The reference to Gabbatha in the Bible provides a vivid detail of the setting of Jesus' trial and the events leading up to his crucifixion. It also offers insight into the political and judicial realities of the time, as well as the significance of the location where the momentous decision regarding Jesus' fate was made.",

Paul visited the region of Galatia on his first and second missionary journeys (Acts 16:6; 18:23), establishing churches and preaching the gospel. He later wrote a letter to the churches in Galatia, addressing issues of faith, justification, and Christian liberty (Galatians 1:2). In his epistle, Paul expressed concern about the Galatians being led astray by false teachings and emphasized the importance of salvation through faith in Christ alone (Galatians 3:1; 6:18). Galatia is also mentioned in other New Testament passages, such as 1 Corinthians 16:1, where Paul instructs the Galatian churches to participate in a collection for the believers in Jerusalem, and 2 Timothy 4:10, where it is noted that Crescens had gone to Galatia.

    "longDescription": "Galilee is a region located in northern Israel, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee to the east, and the Jezreel Valley to the south. In the Old Testament, Galilee is mentioned as part of the tribal allotments of Naphtali (Joshua 20:7) and Zebulun (Joshua 21:32), and as a region that Solomon gave to Hiram, king of Tyre (1 Kings 9:11). ¶In the New Testament, Galilee plays a significant role in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a town in Galilee (Luke 2:39), and began his public ministry in the region after being baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:13; Mark 1:9). Many of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John, were from Galilee (Acts 1:11). ¶Throughout the Gospels, Jesus is recorded as traveling and teaching extensively in Galilee, performing miracles and drawing large crowds (Matthew 4:23-25; Mark 1:28, 39; Luke 4:14, 44). Notable events in Galilee include the wedding at Cana (John 2:1-11), the healing of the centurion's servant (Luke 7:1-10), and the feeding of the five thousand (Luke 9:10-17). ¶Galilee was also the location of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to his disciples (Matthew 28:7, 10, 16; John 21:1-14). After Jesus' ascension, the early church spread throughout Galilee, Judea, and Samaria (Acts 9:31). ¶In addition to its religious significance, Galilee was known for its agricultural fertility and was an important center of trade and commerce. The region was inhabited by a mix of Jews and Gentiles, and was known for its distinct accent and dialect (Matthew 26:69; Mark 14:70; Luke 22:59). ¶The Bible also mentions several political and social events connected to Galilee, such as the census during the time of Jesus' birth (Luke 2:1-4), the rule of Herod Antipas as tetrarch of Galilee (Luke 3:1), and the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices (Luke 13:1-2).",

This event occurred during the time when David was fleeing from Saul's pursuit and Saul had given Michal to Paltiel as a political move to strengthen his own position. ¶Later, in Isaiah 10:30, Gallim is mentioned in a prophetic passage describing the advance of the Assyrian army toward Jerusalem. In this context, the town is personified as a daughter who is called to cry out, along with other nearby towns, in the face of the impending invasion. ¶The exact location of Gallim is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to have been situated north of Jerusalem, possibly near the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. The name \"Gallim\" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning \"springs\" or \"heaps,\" possibly indicating the presence of water sources or mounds in the area.",

Some scholars propose that they may have been a tribe or clan from the region around Tyre, possibly of Phoenician or Syrian origin, but this remains uncertain. ¶The mention of the Gamad in Ezekiel's prophecy serves to underscore the extensive network of alliances and trade relationships that Tyre had established, as well as the city's formidable defenses. However, despite the presence of the Gamad and other defenders, Ezekiel's prophecy ultimately foretells the downfall and destruction of Tyre at the hands of its enemies.",

The name \"Gareb\" is derived from a Hebrew word meaning \"scabby\" or \"leprous,\" which may suggest that the hill was associated with a place where people with skin diseases were quarantined. ¶Jeremiah's prophecy indicates that, in the future, Jerusalem will be rebuilt and its boundaries will be extended to include the hill of Gareb. This expansion of the city's limits symbolizes the growth and prosperity that will characterize Jerusalem during the time of its restoration. ¶Although the hill of Gareb is only mentioned briefly in the Bible, its inclusion in Jeremiah's prophecy highlights the significance of Jerusalem's future restoration and the importance of its expanded boundaries.",

    "longDescription": "Gath was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, along with Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron (Joshua 13:3). It was located in the coastal plain of Philistia, near the border with Judah. The city is mentioned numerous times throughout the Old Testament, often in the context of conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines. ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Gath was one of the last strongholds of the Anakim, a race of giants (Joshua 11:22). The city gained prominence as the hometown of Goliath, the giant warrior who was defeated by David in single combat (1 Samuel 17:4, 23). ¶Gath played a significant role in the life of David. When fleeing from King Saul, David sought refuge in Gath, where he pretended to be insane to avoid arousing suspicion (1 Samuel 21:10-15). Later, David returned to Gath and served under King Achish, who gave him the town of Ziklag (1 Samuel 27:2-6). ¶The city was captured by David during his reign as king (1 Chronicles 18:1), and it was also attacked by later Israelite kings, such as Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6) and Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:8). The term \"Gittite\" is used to refer to people from Gath, such as Obed-Edom, in whose house the Ark of the Covenant was temporarily kept (2 Samuel 6:10-11). ¶Gath is also mentioned in prophetic texts, such as Amos 6:2 and Micah 1:10, which speak of the city's destruction and the fate of its inhabitants. The exact location of Gath is uncertain, but it is believed to be Tell es-Safi, an archaeological site in modern-day Israel.",

Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Lower Galilee, near the border with Asher. ¶Apart from being the birthplace of Jonah, no other significant events or individuals are associated with Gath-hepher in the Bible. The mention of Jonah's origins in 2 Kings 14:25 serves to provide background information about the prophet and to emphasize his Israelite heritage. ¶The name Gath-hepher is composed of two elements: \"Gath,\" meaning \"winepress,\" and \"hepher,\" which may be derived from a root meaning \"to dig\" or \"to explore.\" This suggests that the town may have been known for its wine production or its location near a significant well or water source.",

The city is associated with two different tribes: Dan and Manasseh. ¶In Joshua 19:45, Gath-rimmon is listed among the cities allotted to the tribe of Dan in the coastal plain of Canaan. Later, in Joshua 21:24 and 1 Chronicles 6:69, it is mentioned as one of the cities given to the Kohathite Levites within the territory of Dan. ¶However, in the parallel passage of 1 Chronicles 6:70, Gath-rimmon is also listed among the cities given to the Kohathite Levites within the territory of Manasseh. This apparent discrepancy may be due to textual errors or could indicate that there were two cities named Gath-rimmon, one in Dan and another in Manasseh. ¶The Levites, who were not given a specific territorial inheritance like the other tribes, were distributed among the various tribes to serve as priests, teachers, and judges. The Levitical cities, such as Gath-rimmon, provided them with places to live and pasture lands for their livestock. ¶The name Gath-rimmon is composed of two elements: \"Gath,\" meaning \"winepress,\" and \"rimmon,\" which can mean \"pomegranate\" or \"thunderbolt.\" This suggests that the city may have been known for its wine production or its location near a prominent pomegranate grove or a place associated with thunderstorms.",

    "longDescription": "Gaza, also known as Ayyah, was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, along with Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron (Joshua 13:3). Located in the southwestern coastal plain of Canaan, Gaza was situated near the border with Egypt and served as an important trade center. ¶The city is first mentioned in Genesis 10:19 as part of the description of the Canaanite territories. During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua defeated the king of Gaza (Joshua 10:41), but the city remained under Philistine control (Joshua 11:22). ¶Gaza is perhaps best known for its association with Samson, the Israelite judge with extraordinary strength. Samson visited Gaza and fell in love with a Philistine woman named Delilah (Judges 16:1). Later, after being betrayed by Delilah and captured by the Philistines, Samson was imprisoned in Gaza and ultimately brought down the temple of Dagon, killing himself and many Philistines (Judges 16:21-30). ¶Throughout the Old Testament, Gaza is mentioned in the context of conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines (Judges 6:4; 1 Samuel 6:17) and as a target of prophetic judgment (Jeremiah 47:5; Amos 1:6-7; Zephaniah 2:4; Zechariah 9:5). ¶In the New Testament, Gaza is mentioned in Acts 8:26, where an angel directs Philip the evangelist to travel on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza. Along this road, Philip encounters an Ethiopian eunuch and shares the gospel with him, leading to the eunuch's conversion and baptism. ¶The name Gaza is believed to be derived from the Hebrew root meaning \"to be strong\" or \"to be fierce,\" possibly reflecting the city's reputation as a well-fortified and powerful center. The name Ayyah, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 7:28, is thought to be an alternate name for Gaza or a nearby town.",

Later, during the reign of King Asa of Judah, Geba was fortified using materials from Ramah, which Asa had destroyed (1 Kings 15:22; 2 Chronicles 16:6). ¶After the Babylonian exile, Geba was one of the cities resettled by the returning Israelites (Ezra 2:26; Nehemiah 7:30). It was also mentioned as a city inhabited by the Levites and singers (Nehemiah 11:31; 12:29). ¶The prophet Isaiah mentions Geba in a prophecy concerning the advance of the Assyrian army towards Jerusalem (Isaiah 10:29). In a future prophecy, Zechariah declares that the land will be inhabited from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, indicating the extent of the restored land (Zechariah 14:10). ¶Geba's location on the northern border of Judah made it a strategically important city throughout Israel's history, serving as a defensive outpost and a Levitical city.",

The \"elders\" and \"wise men\" of Gebal are specifically mentioned as being employed on Tyrian ships. ¶Gebal is also listed in Psalm 83:7 among the nations that formed a coalition against Israel, along with Edom, Moab, and others. This suggests that Gebal, at times, was hostile towards Israel and aligned with its enemies. ¶However, in 1 Kings 5:18, the Gebalites (people of Gebal) are mentioned alongside the Sidonians as skilled stonecutters who helped prepare the stones for the construction of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem. This indicates that Gebal also had a role in providing materials and labor for this important project. ¶The city of Gebal has a long history, with evidence of occupation dating back to the Bronze Age. It was an important center of trade and religion, particularly associated with the worship of the goddess Baalat Gebal. The city's strategic location and its valuable resources, such as cedar wood and skilled artisans, made it a significant player in the region's political and economic landscape.",

In 1 Chronicles 27:28, Baal-hanan the Gederite is mentioned as one of David's overseers in charge of the olive and sycamore trees in the Shephelah region, indicating that he likely hailed from Gederah. ¶Additionally, in 1 Chronicles 12:4, Jozabad the Gederathite is listed among David's mighty men who joined him at Ziklag when he was fleeing from Saul. This suggests that Jozabad was a skilled warrior from Gederah who pledged his allegiance to David. ¶The exact location of Gederah is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the Shephelah and its proximity to other known towns, it is believed to have been situated in the western foothills of Judah, southwest of Jerusalem.",

They also attacked the Negev region and settled in the captured towns. ¶The Philistine conquest of Gederoth and other towns in the Shephelah demonstrates the vulnerability of Judah's borders and the ongoing threat posed by its neighboring enemies.

This Gedor is likely a different location from the town of Gedor mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. ¶According to the text, the Simeonites, faced with a shortage of pasture for their growing herds, traveled to the entrance of Gedor, to the east of the valley, in search of suitable grazing land. They found rich and good pasture there, and the land was spacious, quiet, and peaceful, as some of the descendants of Ham had previously settled there. ¶The Simeonites, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, attacked and defeated the Hamites and Meunites who inhabited the region, destroying them completely. They then settled in the area themselves, as it provided ample pasture for their flocks. ¶This event took place during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, which suggests that it occurred sometime between 715 and 686 BC. The Simeonites' search for new pasture lands reflects the challenges faced by pastoral communities in ancient Israel and their willingness to migrate and engage in conflict to secure resources for their livestock. ¶The specific location of this Gedor is uncertain, but it is described as being to the east of a valley and having been previously inhabited by descendants of Ham, suggesting that it may have been situated in the Negev region or beyond, possibly in the direction of Edom or Sinai.",

The passage states that some of the Benjamites, along with people from Judah, settled in various towns, including Ge-harashim. ¶The mention of Benjamites settling in Ge-harashim during the post-exilic period indicates that the valley had become a place of residence for people from different tribes, particularly those known for their craftsmanship and artisanal skills. ¶The exact location of Ge-harashim is not specified in the Bible, but based on its association with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, it is believed to have been situated somewhere in the Judean hill country, possibly near Jerusalem or in the Shephelah region. ¶The name \"Valley of Craftsmen\" suggests that the area was known for its concentration of skilled artisans, possibly including metalworkers, potters, weavers, and other craftsmen.

It is mentioned in the New Testament Gospels in connection with several events in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. ¶In Matthew 14:34 and Mark 6:53, Gennesaret is described as the place where Jesus and his disciples landed after crossing the Sea of Galilee, following the miraculous feeding of the five thousand and Jesus walking on water. Upon landing, the people of the region recognized Jesus and brought the sick to him to be healed. ¶Luke 5:1 mentions the Lake of Gennesaret as the location where Jesus taught the crowds from Simon Peter's boat and performed the miraculous catch of fish, leading to the calling of Peter, James, and John as his disciples. ¶The Plain of Gennesaret is known for its fertile soil and mild climate, which allow for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops. In ancient times, the region was famous for its wheat, barley, melons, figs, and other fruits. The area was also known for its fishing industry, as the Sea of Galilee was rich in fish. ¶The exact extent of the Plain of Gennesaret is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally believed to have stretched from the town of Capernaum in the north to the town of Magdala in the south, covering an area of approximately 3 miles long and 1 mile wide (5 km by 1.6 km). ¶The region's fertility and its proximity to the Sea of Galilee made it an important agricultural and economic center in ancient times. The mention of Gennesaret in the Gospels highlights the significance of the area in the context of Jesus' ministry and the impact of his teachings and miracles on the local population.",

It was located in the region between Kadesh and Shur, in what would become the southern part of Philistine territory. ¶ The city features prominently in patriarchal narratives. Abraham sojourned there, where its king Abimelech ruled. During this stay, Abraham presented Sarah as his sister, leading to a diplomatic incident with Abimelech (Genesis 20:1-2). Later, Isaac also dwelt in Gerar during a famine, repeating his father's pattern by claiming Rebekah was his sister (Genesis 26:1,6). ¶ Gerar possessed valuable agricultural land and water resources. Isaac sowed crops there and received a hundredfold return. The area was known for its wells, which became sources of conflict between Isaac's herdsmen and those of Gerar (Genesis 26:17,20). Despite these tensions, the king of Gerar ultimately sought a peace treaty with Isaac (Genesis 26:26). ¶ Several centuries later, King Asa of Judah pursued defeated enemies to Gerar in a major military campaign. His forces captured the city and plundered all the surrounding towns, which were noted to contain much spoil (2 Chronicles 14:13-14). ¶ Probably corresponds to Tell Abu Hureira (Tel Haror) in the northern Negev of modern Israel, though some scholars suggest Tel Gerar as an alternative location. ¶ Gerar was a significant city spanning from patriarchal times through the period of the divided monarchy, notable for both its agricultural resources and strategic importance.",

    "longDescription": "Gerasa (or Gadara) is mentioned in the Synoptic Gospels as the region where Jesus performed a notable miracle, healing a man (or two men, according to Matthew) who was possessed by demons. The accounts of this event are found in Mark 5:1, Luke 8:26-37, and Matthew 8:28-34. ¶According to the Gospel narratives, after crossing the Sea of Galilee, Jesus and his disciples arrived in the region of the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes). There, they encountered a man (or two men) who was possessed by demons and lived among the tombs. The demon-possessed man was extremely violent and could not be restrained, even with chains. ¶When Jesus commanded the demons to come out of the man, they begged him to send them into a nearby herd of pigs. Jesus granted their request, and the demons entered the pigs, causing the herd to rush down a steep bank into the Sea of Galilee and drown. The man (or men) was then found sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind. ¶The exact location of this event is somewhat uncertain, as there are textual variations in the Gospels regarding the name of the place. Some manuscripts mention the region of the Gerasenes, while others refer to the Gadarenes. Gerasa (modern-day Jerash) was a city located about 37 miles (60 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee, while Gadara (modern-day Umm Qais) was a city located about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee. The discrepancy in the location has led to various explanations: ¶1) The region of the Gerasenes/Gadarenes may have extended to the Sea of Galilee, even though the cities were some distance away. The \"country of the Gerasenes/Gadarenes\" could refer to a wider area around these cities. ¶2) There may have been a small town called Gergesa or Gersa near the Sea of Galilee, which was part of the larger region of the Gerasenes or Gadarenes. Some ancient manuscripts mention the \"Gergesenes,\" possibly referring to this town. ¶3) The gospel writers may have used the names of the larger, more well-known cities to help their readers understand the general location, even if the exact site was closer to the Sea of Galilee. ¶4) Matthew, writing primarily to a Jewish audience, may have used \"Gadarenes\" because Gadara was a prominent city in the region, while Mark and Luke, writing to Gentile audiences, used \"Gerasenes\" as Gerasa was an important Gentile city. ¶Despite the variations in the place names, the gospel accounts agree that the healing of the demoniac took place on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, in a predominantly Gentile region. The presence of pigs, considered unclean by Jews, further confirms the Gentile character of the area.",

    "longDescription": "Mount Gerizim is a mountain located in Samaria, near the ancient city of Shechem. It is mentioned in the Bible as a place of significant events and religious importance. ¶In Deuteronomy 11:29 and 27:12, Moses instructed the Israelites that when they crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land, they were to pronounce blessings from Mount Gerizim and curses from Mount Ebal. This event took place under Joshua's leadership, as recorded in Joshua 8:33, where half of the tribes stood in front of Mount Gerizim and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as the blessings and curses were read aloud. ¶Mount Gerizim is also associated with the parable of Jotham, son of Gideon, as recorded in Judges 9:7. After his brother Abimelech killed their seventy brothers and was made king by the men of Shechem, Jotham stood on top of Mount Gerizim and told a parable about the trees anointing a king over themselves. The parable was a warning against Abimelech's treachery and the folly of the men of Shechem in supporting him. ¶In later history, Mount Gerizim became a sacred site for the Samaritans, who built a temple there in the 5th century BC. They believed that Mount Gerizim, rather than Jerusalem, was the chosen place for worship. This led to tensions between the Samaritans and the Jews, as evident in the conversation between Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:20-21). ¶Today, Mount Gerizim, along with Mount Ebal, continues to be an important religious and archaeological site, with ruins of the Samaritan temple and other ancient structures still visible.",

    "longDescription": "Geruth Chimham is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Jeremiah 41:17, in the context of the events following the Babylonian conquest of Judah and the murder of Gedaliah, the appointed governor. ¶After Gedaliah was assassinated by Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, a group of leaders led by Johanan, son of Kareah, pursued Ishmael and rescued the captives he had taken. Fearing retaliation from the Babylonians for Gedaliah's murder, Johanan and his group, along with the rescued captives, sought refuge in Geruth Chimham, which was near Bethlehem. ¶The name \"Geruth Chimham\" suggests that it was a lodging place or caravanserai associated with someone named Chimham. Some scholars believe that this Chimham may have been the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, who is mentioned in 2 Samuel 19:37-40 as having provided for King David during his flight from Absalom. David, in return, offered to care for Chimham and allow him to return to Jerusalem with him. ¶If this connection is accurate, it is possible that David granted Chimham a piece of land near Bethlehem, where he established a lodging place for travelers. This would explain why Johanan and his group sought refuge there, as it was a known and established location. ¶The mention of Geruth Chimham in Jeremiah 41:17 highlights the chaos and fear that followed the Babylonian conquest and the murder of Gedaliah, as well as the desperate measures taken by those seeking to escape potential retribution. It also provides a glimpse into the practice of establishing lodging places for travelers in ancient times.",

    "shortDescription": "Geshur, an Aramean kingdom ruled by Talmai, was the homeland of David's wife Maacah and a refuge for Absalom after he murdered his half-brother Amnon.",
    "longDescription": "Geshur was an Aramean kingdom located northeast of the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Bashan. It bordered the Israelite territories of Manasseh and Maacah, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 3:14 and Joshua 12:5; 13:11. ¶The kingdom of Geshur played a significant role in the life of King David and his family. David married Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (2 Samuel 3:3; 1 Chronicles 3:2). Maacah was the mother of Absalom and Tamar, two of David's children who were involved in a tragic family conflict. ¶After Absalom murdered his half-brother Amnon in revenge for the rape of his sister Tamar, he fled to Geshur and sought refuge with his grandfather, King Talmai (2 Samuel 13:37-38). Absalom remained in Geshur for three years before Joab, David's commander, arranged for his return to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 14:23,32). ¶Later, when Absalom rebelled against his father David, he went to Geshur to gather support and raise an army (2 Samuel 15:8). This suggests that Absalom maintained ties with his maternal grandfather's kingdom and used it as a base for his political ambitions. ¶In Joshua 13:13, it is mentioned that the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites, indicating that they coexisted with the Aramean kingdom. However, during the reign of Solomon, it seems that Geshur came under Israelite control, as 1 Chronicles 2:23 mentions that Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took Geshur and Aram and their towns. ¶The biblical narrative portrays Geshur as an independent Aramean kingdom that had close ties with the Israelite royal family through marriage alliances. Its location and political significance made it a place of refuge and a potential source of support for those involved in the power struggles within the Israelite monarchy.",

He took Peter, James, and John with him and asked them to stay awake and pray while he went further into the garden to pray alone. In his agony, Jesus prayed, \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will\" (Matthew 26:39). ¶During his prayer, Jesus was deeply distressed and sorrowful, to the point of sweating drops of blood (Luke 22:44). This intense emotional and spiritual struggle underscores the significance of Gethsemane as the place where Jesus fully embraced his impending suffering and death. After his prayer, Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot and arrested.",

Although the city was assigned to the Levites (Joshua 21:21; 1 Chronicles 6:67), the Ephraimites failed to drive out the Canaanites, who continued to live there (Joshua 16:10; Judges 1:29). During the reign of David, the Israelites fought battles against the Philistines at Gob (Gezer), where David's warriors defeated the giants (2 Samuel 21:18-19; 1 Chronicles 20:4). David also defeated the Philistines from Geba to Gezer (2 Samuel 5:25; 1 Chronicles 14:16). Later, King Solomon fortified Gezer, along with other key cities, using the labor of the Canaanites (1 Kings 9:15-17). Gezer is mentioned as part of the inheritance of the descendants of Ephraim (1 Chronicles 7:28).

Abner, the commander of Ishbosheth's army, was retreating after being defeated. Joab and Abishai, David's generals and brothers, pursued Abner and his men. ¶The text states that the pursuit continued \"on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon\" and that \"the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon\" (2 Samuel 2:24, ESV). ¶No further details are provided about Giah. It seems to have been a known landmark on the road from Gibeon toward the wilderness area to the east. The mention of the \"hill of Ammah\" suggests Giah was located in hilly terrain. ¶Apart from this single reference, Giah is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in any known extra-biblical sources. Its exact location remains unknown, though it can be generally placed in the vicinity of Gibeon, probably to the east.",

Later, during the reign of Baasha's son Elah, the Israelite army was again besieging Gibbethon when Zimri, a commander of chariots, conspired against Elah and killed him (1 Kings 16:15). The siege of Gibbethon by the Israelite army suggests that the city may have been under Philistine control at the time. These events highlight the strategic importance of Gibbethon and its role in the power struggles within the Northern Kingdom of Israel.",

The city was also the birthplace and residence of Saul, the first king of Israel (1 Samuel 10:26; 15:34). Saul and his son Jonathan used Gibeah as a base of operations during their battles against the Philistines (1 Samuel 13:2, 15; 14:2, 16). The city is mentioned in the context of David's flight from Saul (1 Samuel 22:6; 23:19; 26:1) and in the account of the hanging of Saul's descendants (2 Samuel 21:6). Gibeah is also listed among the cities of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28; 1 Chronicles 12:3) and is mentioned in prophetic passages (Isaiah 10:29; Hosea 5:8; 9:9; 10:9). The atrocities committed at Gibeah became a byword for the moral decay and lawlessness of the time, serving as a warning and a call to repentance for future generations.",

Despite the deception, Joshua honored the treaty when the truth was discovered. ¶Gibeon's importance is underscored by the fact that its king, Hoham, led a coalition of five Amorite kings against Israel (Joshua 10:1-5). In response, Joshua asked God for the sun to stand still during the ensuing battle, allowing Israel to defeat the coalition (Joshua 10:12-14). ¶After the conquest, Gibeon was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin and designated as a Levitical city (Joshua 18:25, 21:17). The tabernacle was set up at Gibeon for a period, and it became a major worship center (1 Chronicles 16:39, 21:29).",

However, the Israelites set an ambush and lured the Benjamites away from Gibeah. As the Benjamites were retreating, they were pursued by the Israelites on the road to Gidom (Judges 20:45). The Israelites overtook the Benjamites and defeated them, striking down many of them. The reference to Gidom suggests that it was a known location near Gibeah, possibly on the route of the Benjamites' retreat. Apart from this single mention, no further details about Gidom are provided in the Bible, and its exact location is unknown.",

Second, Gihon is the name of a spring located near Jerusalem, which played a significant role in the city's water supply and in the anointing of King Solomon. It was at the Gihon spring that Solomon was anointed as king by the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan (1 Kings 1:33, 38, 45). King Hezekiah later directed the waters of the Gihon spring through a tunnel to the west side of the City of David, ensuring a reliable water supply for Jerusalem during times of siege (2 Chronicles 32:30). King Manasseh, Hezekiah's son, built a wall outside the City of David, extending it to the west of the Gihon spring (2 Chronicles 33:14). The Gihon spring's location and its importance for Jerusalem's water supply make it a significant site in the city's history and in the narratives of the Israelite monarchy.",

In the ensuing battle, the Philistines fought fiercely against Israel, and Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, were killed on Mount Gilboa (1 Samuel 31:1-6). After the battle, the Philistines found the bodies of Saul and his sons and fastened them to the wall of Beth-shan (1 Samuel 31:10). Later, valiant men from Jabesh-gilead retrieved the bodies and buried them (1 Samuel 31:11-13; 2 Samuel 21:12). In his lament for Saul and Jonathan, David cursed the mountains of Gilboa, expressing his grief over their deaths (2 Samuel 1:21). The events at Mount Gilboa marked the end of Saul's reign and paved the way for David to become king over Israel. The mountain range stands as a reminder of the tragic fate of Saul and his sons and the transfer of power to the Davidic dynasty.",

The Philistines had gathered their forces to fight against Israel, and the two armies met on Mount Gilboa (1 Samuel 31:1; 1 Chronicles 10:1). In the fierce battle that ensued, the Philistines prevailed, and Saul and his sons were slain on the mountain (1 Samuel 31:8; 1 Chronicles 10:8). The Philistines found their bodies the following day and desecrated them, displaying them on the walls of Beth-shan. The men of Jabesh-gilead later retrieved the bodies and buried them. Mount Gilboa is also mentioned in the account of Gideon's victory over the Midianites, where some of his fearful troops were allowed to depart from the mountain (Judges 7:3). The mountain range stands as a reminder of the tragic end of Saul's reign and the transfer of power to David, who would become Israel's next king.",

It was from Gilgal that Elijah set out on his final journey before being taken up to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:1). Elisha, who had been anointed as Elijah's successor, returned to Gilgal after Elijah's departure. Later, during a time of famine, Elisha was in Gilgal with a group of prophets known as the \"sons of the prophets\" (2 Kings 4:38). While there, Elisha performed a miracle by making a poisonous stew edible, demonstrating his prophetic power and divine authority. This Gilgal seems to have been a location where a community of prophets lived and trained, possibly different from the Gilgal mentioned in the books of Joshua and Samuel. The exact location of this Gilgal is uncertain, but it was likely in the northern part of Israel, given its association with the prophetic ministries of Elijah and Elisha.",

    "longDescription": "Gilgal, also referred to as Geliloth, Beth-gilgal, or Gibeath-haaraloth, was a significant site during Israel's early history in Canaan. It was located in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. Gilgal served as the first campsite for the Israelites after they crossed the Jordan River under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 4:19-20). It was at Gilgal that the Israelites set up twelve memorial stones taken from the Jordan and where Joshua circumcised the new generation born in the wilderness (Joshua 5:3, 9). The Passover was also celebrated at Gilgal (Joshua 5:10). Gilgal served as a base of operations for Joshua during the conquest of Canaan, with the Gibeonites coming to seek a treaty there (Joshua 9:6) and Joshua launching campaigns against the Amorite kings from Gilgal (Joshua 10:6-9, 15, 43). Later, it became a place where the Israelites assembled and where Saul was confirmed as king (1 Samuel 11:14-15). Samuel included Gilgal in his circuit as a judge (1 Samuel 7:16). However, Gilgal also became associated with idolatrous worship, as evidenced by the prophets' condemnations (Hosea 4:15; 9:15; 12:11; Amos 4:4; 5:5). Despite its significance in Israel's history, Gilgal's importance declined over time.",

However, during Absalom's rebellion against David, Ahithophel sided with Absalom and provided him with counsel (2 Samuel 15:12). Ahithophel's defection was a significant blow to David, given his reputation for wisdom and insight. When Absalom rejected Ahithophel's advice in favor of Hushai's counsel, Ahithophel returned to Giloh and hanged himself, perceiving that Absalom's cause was doomed (2 Samuel 17:23). Apart from its association with Ahithophel, little else is known about Giloh from the biblical text. Its mention in the narrative of Absalom's rebellion highlights the political and personal turmoil that David faced during his reign.",

The first reference is in 2 Samuel 4:3, which states that the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and lived there as foreigners. This event is connected to the assassination of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, by two Beerothites (2 Samuel 4:5-8). ¶Beeroth was one of the four cities of the Gibeonites, who had deceived Joshua into making a peace treaty (Joshua 9:17). The flight of the Beerothites to Gittaim suggests that the town was a place of refuge, possibly located outside Israelite territory. ¶The second reference to Gittaim is in Nehemiah 11:33, which lists the towns inhabited by the Benjamites after their return from Babylonian exile. Gittaim is mentioned along with other towns in the region, indicating that it was resettled by the Benjamites during the post-exilic period. ¶The exact location of Gittaim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in Benjamite territory, north of Jerusalem. Some scholars suggest it may be identified with modern-day Ras Abu Kharrubeh, about 6 miles northeast of Jerusalem. ¶Apart from these two brief references, no other information about Gittaim is provided in the Bible. Its significance lies in its connection to the Beerothites' flight and its later resettlement by the Benjamites.",

Gog is portrayed as a powerful enemy who will lead a coalition of nations in an attack against Israel in the latter days (Ezekiel 38:14-16). However, God will intervene and defeat Gog and his armies, demonstrating His power and sovereignty (Ezekiel 38:18-23; 39:1-6). The prophecy also mentions that Gog's forces will be buried in a place called the Valley of Hamon-gog, and the land will be cleansed (Ezekiel 39:11-16). In the book of Revelation, Gog and Magog are mentioned together, representing the nations that will be deceived by Satan and gather for battle against God's people at the end of the millennial reign (Revelation 20:8). The names Gog and Magog are symbolic, representing the final enemies of God's kingdom who will be ultimately defeated. The prophecies concerning Gog emphasize God's sovereignty, the certainty of His judgment against His enemies, and the ultimate victory of His people.",

Golan was also allotted to the Levites of the family of Gershon, along with other cities in the region, as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Joshua 21:27; 1 Chronicles 6:71). This allocation of cities to the Levites ensured that they would be dispersed throughout the land and could carry out their priestly duties among the various tribes of Israel.

The exact reason for the name is not specified in the Bible, but it may refer to the physical appearance of the site, resembling a skull, or it could be associated with a place of execution. The Gospel accounts describe how Jesus, after being sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate, was led to Golgotha, where he was crucified along with two criminals. The location of Golgotha was outside the city walls, as was customary for executions in ancient times. It is also mentioned that the site was near a garden and a tomb, which belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, where Jesus' body was later laid (John 19:41-42). The crucifixion at Golgotha is the central event in the Christian faith, as it represents Jesus' sacrificial death for the sins of humanity, leading to his resurrection and the offer of salvation to all who believe in him.",

When God revealed His plan to destroy the cities to Abraham, the patriarch pleaded for their survival if even ten righteous people could be found (Genesis 18:23-32). Ultimately, only Lot and his two daughters were spared, while Gomorrah and the other cities were destroyed by sulfur and fire from heaven (Genesis 19:24-25). ¶The destruction of Gomorrah and Sodom became a symbol of God's judgment against sin and a warning to future generations (Deuteronomy 29:23, 32:32; Isaiah 1:9-10, 13:19; Jeremiah 23:14, 49:18, 50:40; Amos 4:11; Zephaniah 2:9). In the New Testament, Jesus used Sodom and Gomorrah as an example of the fate awaiting those who reject the gospel message (Matthew 10:15; Mark 6:11; Luke 10:12). ¶The apostle Peter cited the destruction of these cities as proof of God's judgment against the ungodly and His deliverance of the righteous (2 Peter 2:6-9). Jude also referred to Sodom and Gomorrah as an example of the punishment awaiting those who indulge in sexual immorality and perversion (Jude 1:7). ¶The exact location of Gomorrah remains unknown, as the cities were completely destroyed. However, it is believed to have been situated in the area south of the Dead Sea, possibly submerged beneath its waters.",

Jacob sent Judah ahead to meet Joseph and be directed to Goshen (Genesis 46:28-29). The Israelites presented themselves to Pharaoh and requested to settle in Goshen as shepherds (Genesis 46:34; 47:1, 4). Pharaoh granted their request and allowed them to live in the best part of the land of Goshen (Genesis 47:6). The Israelites prospered and multiplied greatly in Goshen (Genesis 47:27). During the plagues that God sent upon Egypt, Goshen was spared from the swarms of flies and the plague of hail (Exodus 8:22; 9:26). At the time of the Exodus, the Israelites left Egypt from the region of Goshen (Genesis 50:8). The exact location of Goshen is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be in the eastern part of the Nile Delta, possibly in the Wadi Tumilat area.",

The Assyrian practice of deporting conquered populations was a means of controlling and assimilating them into the Assyrian Empire. The exact location of Gozan is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed to be associated with the Khabur River, a tributary of the Euphrates River in northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey. The name Gozan is also mentioned in the context of Sennacherib's boasting about the Assyrian conquests, where he claims that the gods of the nations, including those of Gozan, could not deliver their lands from his power (2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:12). The deportation of the Israelites to Gozan and other regions marked the end of the northern kingdom of Israel and the beginning of the Assyrian exile.",

The Great Sea played a significant role in the history and geography of the region, with many important cities and ports located along its coast. The Philistines, who were a major enemy of the Israelites, occupied the coastal plain along the Great Sea (Joshua 9:1; 15:47). In the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, the Great Sea is mentioned in the context of the boundaries of the restored land of Israel (Ezekiel 47:10, 15, 19; 48:28).

The term \"Hellenist\" is used to describe Greek-speaking Jews who had adopted Greek culture (Acts 6:1; 9:29; 11:20). These references highlight the significant influence of Greek culture and language in the ancient world, as well as the tension between Greek and Jewish cultures during the time of the early church.",

    "longDescription": "The Guard Gate, also known as the Prison Gate in the King James Version, was one of the gates in the wall of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah. It is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Nehemiah 12:39, during the description of the dedication ceremony for the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem. ¶During this dedication, Nehemiah divided the leaders of Judah into two large choirs. One choir proceeded on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate (Nehemiah 12:31). The second choir, which included Nehemiah, went to the left. They marched on the wall past several gates and towers, including the Gate of Ephraim, the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, and the Sheep Gate, until they stopped at the Guard Gate (Nehemiah 12:38-39). ¶Based on its location in the description of the procession, the Guard Gate appears to have been situated on the eastern side of the city, near the Temple area. Many scholars believe it to be the same gate as the Muster Gate or Inspection Gate, mentioned in Nehemiah 3:31 as being near the Temple. ¶The exact purpose of this gate is not specified in the biblical text. Its name suggests it may have been a point where guards were stationed or where prisoners were kept, but this is not stated explicitly. It could also possibly refer to a place where people or goods were inspected before entering the city or Temple precincts. ¶Apart from this single reference in Nehemiah, no other information is provided about the Guard Gate in the Bible. Its mention in the context of the wall's dedication ceremony highlights its significance as part of Jerusalem's fortifications during the post-exilic period.",

The practice of deporting conquered populations was a common strategy employed by the Assyrians to prevent rebellions and to integrate the conquered peoples into their empire. The exact location of the Habor River is not specified in the Bible, but it is generally identified with the Khabur River, a tributary of the Euphrates River, located in modern-day Syria and Iraq. The Khabur River was known for its fertile lands and was an important region in the Assyrian Empire. The deportation of the Israelites to the region of the Habor River marked the end of the northern kingdom and the beginning of the Assyrian captivity, which had a profound impact on the history and identity of the Israelite people.",

Saul sought David in the Wilderness of Ziph and camped at Hachilah (1 Samuel 26:1, 3). David learned of Saul's presence and sent out spies to confirm his location. In a daring move, David and Abishai sneaked into Saul's camp at night and took Saul's spear and water jug, demonstrating that he could have killed Saul but chose to spare his life (1 Samuel 26:4-12). The hill of Hachilah served as a strategic hideout for David, providing him with a vantage point to monitor Saul's movements and evade capture.

This is likely a reference to the lamentation over King Josiah, who was fatally wounded by Pharaoh Neco's archers at Megiddo (2 Chronicles 35:22-25). ¶The name Hadad-rimmon combines the names of two Semitic deities: Hadad, the storm god, and Rimmon, a god of thunder, suggesting the location may have had cultic significance. Its exact location is uncertain, but it has been tentatively identified with Rummaneh, a village in the Jezreel Valley about 6 miles south of Megiddo. ¶Zechariah's prophecy uses this historic event as a metaphor for the intense mourning that will take place when God pours out a spirit of grace and supplication on Jerusalem, causing them to look on the one they have pierced and mourn bitterly (Zechariah 12:10). The comparison emphasizes the depth and sincerity of the people's repentance.",

The town's inclusion in this list indicates that it was part of the region surrounding Jerusalem and played a role in the reestablishment of Jewish communities after the exile.

This event is also described in 2 Kings 18:11, emphasizing that the Israelites were deported because they had sinned against the Lord. ¶The third reference to Halah is in 1 Chronicles 5:26, which states that the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (Tiglath-Pileser III) and the spirit of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, who took the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile, bringing them to Halah and other locations. ¶The exact location of Halah is uncertain, but it is generally believed to have been in the region of the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia (modern-day Syria or Iraq). This area was under Assyrian control during the time of the Israelite exile. ¶The Bible does not provide any further information about Halah or the lives of the exiled Israelites there.

The territory of Asher was located in the western part of the Galilee region, bordering the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to the east.

Its exact location and history remain uncertain, as the town is not mentioned in any other biblical accounts or in known extra-biblical sources. The inclusion of Hali in the list of Asher's towns suggests that it was a settlement of some significance during the time of Joshua and the initial allocation of the land to the Israelite tribes. However, due to the limited information available, the specific details about Hali's size, population, or role in the region cannot be determined with certainty.",

The Hall of Judgment served as a royal court where Solomon would hear cases, settle disputes, and deliver judgments. As the king of Israel, one of Solomon's primary responsibilities was to ensure justice and maintain order in the kingdom. The presence of a dedicated hall for judgment in his palace underscores the importance of this role and Solomon's commitment to wise governance.

It had a portico in front, likely supported by a row of pillars, and a canopy extending from the portico, possibly providing shade or shelter. ¶The specific purpose of this hall is not stated in the text. However, given its location within the palace complex and its impressive size, it may have served as a reception area, a place for public assemblies, or a venue for official ceremonies. ¶The Hall of Pillars was one of several structures mentioned in the description of Solomon's palace, which also included the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Hall of the Throne (or Hall of Judgment), and Solomon's personal residence (1 Kings 7:1-12). These buildings showcased the wealth, power, and architectural achievements of Solomon's reign. ¶The construction of the Hall of Pillars, along with the other palace structures and the Temple, demonstrated Solomon's commitment to establishing Jerusalem as a royal capital and a center of worship. The grandeur of these buildings testified to the prosperity and stability of the united monarchy under Solomon's rule.",

The throne mentioned here likely refers to the royal throne from which Solomon would sit and administer justice. As the king of Israel, Solomon's throne represented his authority and his role as the supreme judge in the land. The Hall of the Throne, therefore, served as the official space where Solomon exercised his judicial responsibilities and made decisions that impacted the lives of his subjects. The use of cedar paneling in the hall added to its grandeur and significance, reflecting the importance of the king's role and the solemnity of the proceedings that took place there.

The city was known for its military strength and strategic importance, as evidenced by its mentions in the context of conflicts and conquests (2 Kings 14:28; 17:24, 30; 18:34; 19:13; Isaiah 10:9; 36:19; 37:13; Jeremiah 39:5; 49:23; 52:9, 27). ¶During the reigns of various Israelite kings, Hamath served as a marker of the extent of their dominion. Jeroboam II, king of Israel, is said to have restored the border of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (2 Kings 14:25). Solomon, known for his expansive kingdom, is described as having ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt, including Tiphsah and Gaza (1 Kings 4:21, 24). ¶The Assyrians conquered Hamath in the 8th century BC and deported some of its inhabitants to Samaria (2 Kings 17:24, 30). The fall of Hamath is mentioned in the prophetic oracles of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos, often in the context of judgment against the city for its pride and wickedness (Isaiah 10:9; Jeremiah 49:23; Amos 6:2). ¶In the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, Hamath is mentioned as one of the boundaries of the restored land of Israel (Ezekiel 47:15-17, 20; 48:1), indicating its continued significance as a geographical marker. ¶The exact location of Hamath is believed to be near the modern-day city of Hama in western Syria, situated along the Orontes River. Its strategic location along trade routes and its proximity to Israel made it a city of great importance in the ancient Near East.",

Some scholars identify it with the modern-day site of Hammat Tiberias, known for its hot springs, located south of Tiberias on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. ¶Apart from its mention in the lists of cities and Levitical towns, no further details about Hammath's history, size, or significance are provided in the Bible.

    "longDescription": "Hamonah is a city mentioned in the prophetic vision of Ezekiel, specifically in Ezekiel 39:16. The name \"Hamonah\" is derived from the Hebrew word \"hamon,\" meaning \"multitude\" or \"horde.\" ¶In the context of Ezekiel's prophecy, Hamonah is associated with the aftermath of the battle against Gog and his armies. The preceding verses describe how God will strike down Gog and his hordes on the mountains of Israel, leaving their bodies to be consumed by birds and beasts (Ezekiel 39:1-4). ¶The slain army of Gog will be so numerous that it will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury them and cleanse the land (Ezekiel 39:12-14). The place where Gog's multitude is buried will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog, meaning \"the multitude of Gog\" (Ezekiel 39:11). ¶After this burial, the city nearby will be renamed Hamonah (Ezekiel 39:16). The renaming of the city to \"Multitude\" or \"Horde\" serves as a lasting reminder of the immense number of Gog's soldiers who were defeated and buried there. ¶The exact location of Hamonah is not specified in the text, and there is no historical record of a city by this name. As Ezekiel's prophecy is highly symbolic and apocalyptic, the city of Hamonah may not refer to a literal, physical city but rather serves as a metaphor for the complete destruction and burial of God's enemies. ¶The prophecy of Hamonah and the defeat of Gog underscores God's ultimate victory over the forces of evil and His protection of His people, Israel. It also emphasizes the importance of cleansing the land from the defilement caused by sin and God's enemies.",

The name \"Hamon-gog\" means \"the multitude of Gog,\" reflecting the vast number of soldiers in Gog's army. The valley is described as being east of the sea, likely referring to the Dead Sea, and it will be a place of renown, known for the mass burial of Gog's defeated forces. ¶The prophecy also mentions that the people of Israel will be burying the remains of Gog's army for seven months to cleanse the land (Ezekiel 39:12-16). The valley will be renamed the \"Valley of Hamon-gog\" as a reminder of God's judgment upon Gog and his forces. ¶The exact location of the Valley of Hamon-gog is not specified in the Bible, as it is a prophetic place associated with future events. The prophecy of Gog and Magog's defeat and the subsequent burial in the Valley of Hamon-gog serves as a powerful message of God's sovereignty and protection over His people, Israel, in the face of overwhelming adversity.",

Some scholars identify it with the city of Heracleopolis Magna, known as \"Hnen-nesut\" in ancient Egyptian texts, which was located near the entrance of the Faiyum region. ¶Isaiah's prophecy condemns Judah's political alliance with Egypt, portraying it as a useless and shameful endeavor. The mention of Hanes, along with Zoan (Tanis), another Egyptian city, highlights the extent of Judah's diplomatic efforts to secure Egypt's support against the impending Assyrian invasion. ¶Apart from this single reference in Isaiah, Hanes is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Its inclusion in the prophecy serves to underscore the futility of Judah's reliance on human alliances, particularly with Egypt, instead of trusting in God for protection and deliverance.",

In the description of Zebulun's boundaries, Hannathon is mentioned as one of the towns marking the eastern border of their territory (Joshua 19:14). ¶The exact location of Hannathon is not specified in the Bible, but based on the description of Zebulun's borders, it is believed to have been situated in the lower Galilee region, likely near the Kishon River. The town's name, Hannathon, is of Hebrew origin and means \"favored\" or \"gracious.\" ¶Apart from its mention in the delineation of Zebulun's territory, no further information about Hannathon is provided in the Bible. Its inclusion in the boundary description suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement during the time of the Israelite conquest and settlement of Canaan. ¶The tribe of Zebulun, along with the tribes of Issachar and Naphtali, occupied the fertile lands of the Galilee region. They were known for their agricultural and commercial activities, benefiting from the region's rich soil and proximity to trade routes.",

From there, they moved on and camped at Terah. Then they set out from Terah and camped at Mithkah. The next stop after Mithkah was Hashmonah, followed by Moseroth, Bene-jaakan, Hor-haggidgad, and Jotbathah. After Jotbathah, they camped at Abronah, and then at Ezion-geber. Finally, they set out from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh. It was after leaving Kadesh that they camped at Mount Hor, and then at Zalmonah, Punon, Oboth, and Iye-abarim. The next stop mentioned after Iye-abarim is Dibon-gad, followed by Almon-diblathaim, and then the mountains of Abarim before Nebo. ¶In this context, Haradah is listed between Hashmonah and Makheloth in the sequence of campsites.  ¶The mention of Haradah in the itinerary of Israel's wilderness journey serves to emphasize God's guidance and provision for His people during their 40-year sojourn in the desert. It also highlights the importance of remembering and recording the various stages of their journey as a testimony to future generations of God's faithfulness and leadership.",

It was in Haran that Terah died (Genesis 11:32), and from there, Abraham departed for Canaan in response to God's call (Genesis 12:4-5). Later, when Israel (or 'Jacob') fled from his brother Esau, he sought refuge in Haran with his uncle Laban (Genesis 27:43; 28:10). Jacob lived in Haran for many years, marrying Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel, and working for Laban (Genesis 29:4). Haran was known for its association with the worship of the moon god, Sin. In the Old Testament, Haran is mentioned as one of the places conquered by the Assyrian kings (2 Kings 19:12; Isaiah 37:12) and as a trading partner of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:23). The city's strategic location along major trade routes contributed to its importance in the ancient Near East.",

Some scholars suggest that Harmon may refer to a place of exile or captivity, possibly in Assyria or Armenia, where the Israelites would be taken as a result of God's judgment. Others propose that it could be a symbolic name representing the fate of the exiled Israelites. The context of the passage suggests that Harmon is a place of punishment and humiliation for the proud and oppressive women of Samaria, who would be driven out of their city and cast into a foreign land. Amos's prophecy serves as a warning against the social injustice and religious unfaithfulness that characterized Israel during his time.",

In Judges 7:1, it is recorded that Gideon and his army camped beside the spring of Harod, while the Midianites were north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. It was at this location that God instructed Gideon to reduce his army from 32,000 men to a mere 300, based on how they drank water from the spring (Judges 7:4-7). This event demonstrated God's power to deliver Israel from their enemies, even with a small force. The exact location of the Spring of Harod is not certain, but it is believed to be in the Jezreel Valley, near the ancient city of Jezreel. The spring is also mentioned in connection with two of David's mighty men, Shammah the Harodite (2 Samuel 23:25) and Elika the Harodite (1 Chronicles 11:27), indicating that it may have been a place of origin or residence for some of David's warriors.

The next stop mentioned after Hashmonah is Moseroth. ¶Some Bible scholars attempt to identify Hashmonah with Azmon, a place mentioned in Numbers 34:4 as part of the southern border of the Promised Land. However, this identification is uncertain and not universally accepted. ¶The mention of Hashmonah in the itinerary of Israel's wilderness journey serves to emphasize God's guidance and provision for His people during their 40-year sojourn in the desert. It also highlights the importance of remembering and recording the various stages of their journey as a testimony to future generations of God's faithfulness and leadership. ¶As with many of the places mentioned in the wilderness itinerary, Hashmonah's significance lies primarily in its role as a marker in Israel's divinely-led journey from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land. Its inclusion in the biblical record underscores the historical and theological importance of this formative period in Israel's history.",

The southern border is described as running from the end of the Salt Sea (the Dead Sea) southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, passing along to Zin, and going south of Kadesh-barnea before proceeding to Hazar-addar and continuing to Azmon. ¶The exact location of Hazar-addar is uncertain, as the town is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. Its inclusion in the boundary description suggests that it was a recognized landmark or settlement in the region during the time of Moses. ¶As part of the southern border, Hazar-addar would have been situated in the arid wilderness region of the Negev, south of Canaan. The name \"Hazar\" is derived from the Hebrew word for \"enclosure\" or \"settlement,\" indicating that it may have been a fortified town or a well-known encampment along the desert route. ¶The mention of Hazar-addar in the biblical text serves to define the extent of the Promised Land and to underscore God's specific instructions to Moses regarding the territory that the Israelites were to possess.

This list is part of a genealogical record of the descendants of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. ¶According to the text, the Simeonites had their inheritance within the territory of Judah, as the land allocated to Judah was too large for them (Joshua 19:9). The list in 1 Chronicles 4 enumerates the towns and villages that were part of Simeon's inheritance. ¶Hazar-susim is listed along with other towns such as Bethul, Hormah, Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-shual. These settlements were located in the Negev region, the southern part of Canaan, known for its arid and semi-arid climate. ¶The exact location of Hazar-susim is uncertain, as the town is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. However, its inclusion in the list of Simeonite towns suggests that it was a recognized settlement within their territory during the time of the chronicler. ¶The mention of Hazar-susim in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allocated to the tribe of Simeon and to underscore the importance of maintaining accurate genealogical records. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance.",

The list of towns is divided into several geographical regions, including the Negev, the lowland, and the hill country. ¶Hazor is listed among other towns in the Negev, such as Kedesh, Ithnan, Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth. The exact location of this Hazor is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. ¶The name \"Hazor\" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning \"enclosure\" or \"settlement,\" suggesting that it may have been a fortified town or a well-known encampment in the region. ¶The mention of Hazor in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah and to underscore the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance. Its inclusion in the list also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the allotment of the land.",

The city was originally named Kiriath-arba, which means \"the city of Arba,\" who was the greatest man among the Anakim (Joshua 14:15). ¶Hebron played a significant role in the lives of the patriarchs. Sarah, Abraham's wife, died in Kiriath-arba, and Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah as a burial site for her (Genesis 23:2, 19). Later, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel (or 'Jacob') were also buried there (Genesis 35:27; 49:29-32). ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Hebron was taken by Joshua and the Israelites (Joshua 10:36-37). The city was given to Caleb as his inheritance (Joshua 14:13-14), and later became a city of the Levites and a city of refuge (Joshua 20:7; 21:11-13). ¶Hebron served as the capital of Judah during the reign of David. He was anointed king over the house of Judah in Hebron and reigned there for seven and a half years (2 Samuel 2:1-4, 11; 5:5). Several of David's sons were born in Hebron, including Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah (2 Samuel 3:2-5). ¶The city remained significant throughout Israel's history. It was fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:10) and was inhabited by Jews after the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 11:25). ¶Hebron is also notable for its association with the Anakim, a group of giants who inhabited the area (Numbers 13:22, 33). Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from Hebron: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai (Joshua 15:13-14; Judges 1:10, 20). ¶Today, Hebron is still an important city, known for the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which is believed to be the burial site of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The city has a rich history and holds great significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.",

The exact meaning and identity of Helech is uncertain, and Bible scholars have proposed different interpretations. ¶One view is that Helech refers to a place, possibly the Assyrian name for the region of Cilicia, located north of the Taurus Mountains. The Cilicians were known for their warlike character and could have served as mercenaries in the army of Tyre, which would fit the context of Ezekiel's prophecy. ¶Another interpretation is that Helech is not a place name but rather a Hebrew term derived from the root word חיל (ḥayil), meaning \"strength\" or \"army.\" In this case, the final letter of Helech would be understood as a feminine form of the pronoun \"you,\" referring to the city of Tyre. This interpretation is supported by the King James Version and the American Standard Version, which translate Helech as \"thine army.\" ¶The Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, seems to favor the interpretation of Helech as a term for Tyre's army rather than a place name. ¶Given the limited information provided in the single biblical reference, the exact identity of Helech remains uncertain. The mention of Helech in Ezekiel's prophecy serves to emphasize the strength and military might of Tyre, which would ultimately be brought to ruin by God's judgment, as declared by the prophet Ezekiel.",

The passage lists the twelve officers who were appointed to provide food for King Solomon and his household, each responsible for a specific region. The district that included Hepher was overseen by the son of Hesed. ¶The fact that Hepher was a city with its own king during the time of Joshua and later became part of a district under Solomon's rule suggests that it was a place of some significance. However, the Bible does not provide any further details about the city's history, size, or importance. ¶The mention of Hepher in the biblical text serves to highlight the extent of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership and the later organization of the kingdom under Solomon's reign.

The mountain marked the northern extent of the Promised Land conquered by Joshua (Josh 11:17; 12:1,5). It was also the northern limit of the territory allocated to the half-tribe of Manasseh (Josh 13:11; 1 Chr 5:23). The Sidonians called the mountain Sirion, while the Amorites called it Senir (Deut 3:9; Ezek 27:5). Mount Hermon was known for its abundant dew (Ps 133:3) and was a source of refreshment for the surrounding lands (Jer 18:14). The mountain was also associated with the Canaanite god Baal, as evidenced by the names Baal-hermon, Baal-hamon, and Baal-gad (Judg 3:3; Song 8:11). Its majestic appearance is celebrated in the Psalms (Ps 29:6; 89:12), and it is mentioned as a place of beauty and fertility (Song 4:8).",

The list of towns is divided into several geographical regions, including the Negev, the lowland, and the hill country. ¶Heshmon is listed among other towns in the Negev, such as Moladah, Hazar-gaddah, Hazar-shual, and Beersheba. The exact location of Heshmon is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. ¶The name \"Heshmon\" is derived from the Hebrew root meaning \"fatness\" or \"fertility,\" which may suggest that the town was situated in a relatively fertile area within the Negev region, known for its arid climate. ¶The mention of Heshmon in the biblical text serves to provide a detailed account of the cities and villages allotted to the tribe of Judah and to underscore the fulfillment of God's promise to give each tribe a portion of the Promised Land as an inheritance. Its inclusion in the list also highlights the importance of geographical accuracy and attention to detail in the recording of Israel's history and the allotment of the land.",

However, the unbelieving Jews stirred up opposition, and Paul and Barnabas had to flee to Lystra and Derbe (Acts 14:19, 21). Later, Paul revisited Iconium to strengthen the disciples (Acts 16:2). In his letter to Timothy, Paul mentions the persecutions he endured in Iconium (2 Timothy 3:11). Iconium was located in the region of Lycaonia and was an important city in the Roman province of Galatia. Today, it is known as Konya, Turkey.",

As a result, the town was attacked, and the virgins of Jabesh were given as wives to the surviving Benjamites. Later, during the reign of King Saul, the Ammonites besieged Jabesh, and Saul came to their rescue, defeating the Ammonites and solidifying his position as king (1 Samuel 11:1-11). After Saul's death, the men of Jabesh bravely retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the Philistines and buried them (1 Samuel 31:11-13; 1 Chronicles 10:11-12). David later praised the men of Jabesh for their loyalty and kindness to Saul (2 Samuel 2:4-7).

During the reign of David, Jazer marked the starting point for the census of Israel (2 Samuel 24:5). The exact location of Jazer is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the border between Gilead and Ammon.",

The city's walls miraculously fell after the Israelites marched around it for seven days, allowing them to destroy the city. Jericho was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18:21) and was later rebuilt during the time of Ahab (1 Kings 16:34). The city also played a role in several other biblical events, such as being the location where the Israelites camped before entering Canaan (Numbers 22:1; 26:3, 63), where Eglon, king of Moab, oppressed Israel (Judges 3:12-14), and where Zedekiah was captured by the Babylonians (Jeremiah 39:5; 52:8).

It is mentioned hundreds of times throughout the Old and New Testaments. The city was originally known as Salem (Genesis 14:18; Psalm 76:2) and was later called Jebus, after the Jebusites who inhabited it (Judges 19:10; 1 Chronicles 11:4). David conquered the city and made it his capital (2 Samuel 5:6-9; 1 Chronicles 11:4-9). Solomon built the first temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6-8; 2 Chronicles 3-7), which became the center of Jewish worship. The city was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC (2 Kings 25:1-10; 2 Chronicles 36:17-19) but was later rebuilt after the exile (Ezra 1:1-4; Nehemiah 2:11-20). In the New Testament, Jerusalem is the site of many events in the life of Jesus, including his triumphal entry (Matthew 21:1-11), cleansing of the temple (Matthew 21:12-17), and crucifixion (Matthew 27:32-56). The early church also began in Jerusalem (Acts 1-7). Throughout the Bible, Jerusalem is referred to by various names, each highlighting a different aspect of its significance: Ariel (Isaiah 29:1), My Delight Is in Her (Isaiah 62:4), Forsaken and Desolate (Isaiah 62:4), Married (Isaiah 62:4), the City of the Lord (Isaiah 60:14), Zion (Psalm 87:2), and Mount Zion (Psalm 48:1). The name \"Jerusalem\" itself may mean \"foundation of peace\" or \"possession of peace.\"",

It is situated between the Galilee region in the north and the Samaria region in the south. The valley is known for its rich agricultural land and has been an important trade route since ancient times. In the Bible, the Jezreel Valley is mentioned as the site of several significant battles. In Judges 6:33, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples camped in the valley to attack Israel, but Gideon defeated them with God's help. The valley is also associated with the defeat of Saul and his sons by the Philistines (1 Samuel 29:1, 31:1-7). In Hosea 1:5, the prophet uses the name \"Jezreel\" symbolically to represent God's judgment on Israel, saying that God will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel. Some scholars believe that the Jezreel Valley may be the site of the future Battle of Armageddon mentioned in Revelation 16:16, although this interpretation is debated.",

The river and its surrounding region, also known as the Jordan Valley or the Plain of Jordan, are mentioned numerous times throughout the Old and New Testaments. The Jordan River formed the eastern boundary of the Promised Land (Numbers 34:12) and was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership when they entered Canaan (Joshua 3-4). The river also served as a boundary between the tribes settling east and west of the Jordan (Joshua 22:25). Several significant events took place along the Jordan, including the parting of the river for Elijah and Elisha (2 Kings 2:6-14), Naaman's healing (2 Kings 5:10-14), and John the Baptist's ministry of baptism (Matthew 3:5-6; Mark 1:5). The Jordan Valley was known for its fertile land, as seen in Lot's choice to settle there (Genesis 13:10-11). The region also served as a refuge for Elijah (1 Kings 17:3-5) and David (2 Samuel 17:22-24). In the New Testament, Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:13; Mark 1:9) and conducted ministry in the region (Matthew 4:25; 19:1). The Jordan River and its surrounding area continue to hold great significance for Christians, Jews, and Muslims today.",

The region played a significant role throughout biblical history, from the time of the judges to the New Testament era. Many important events took place in Judea, including the reigns of King David and King Solomon, the construction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem, and the ministries of Jesus and the early church. Judea was the birthplace of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5, 65) and Jesus (Matthew 2:1, 5). During the New Testament period, Judea was a Roman province, and it was the scene of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection (Luke 23:5; John 19:19-20). The early Christian church began in Jerusalem and spread throughout Judea (Acts 1:8; 2:9). The region's history, culture, and religious significance made it a central focus of both the Old and New Testaments.",

It served as a significant campsite for the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt. Kadesh was the place from which Moses sent the twelve spies to explore the land of Canaan (Numbers 13:26; 32:8). It was also the site where Miriam died and was buried (Numbers 20:1) and where Moses and Aaron disobeyed God by striking the rock to bring forth water (Numbers 20:10-13). The Israelites spent a considerable amount of time at Kadesh (Deuteronomy 1:46) before moving on to other locations in the wilderness. Kadesh was known for its spring (En-mishpat, meaning \"spring of judgment,\" Genesis 14:7) and was a strategic location along trade routes. It also marked the southern boundary of the Promised Land (Numbers 34:4; Joshua 15:3). The Bible mentions several events that took place at Kadesh, including the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16) and the Israelites' refusal to enter the Promised Land, resulting in their forty-year wandering in the wilderness (Numbers 14; Deuteronomy 1:19-46).",

    "longDescription": "Keilah was a town located in the Shephelah, or lowland region, of Judah (Joshua 15:44). During the time of King Saul, the Philistines attacked Keilah and robbed the threshing floors. David, who was fleeing from Saul at the time, inquired of the Lord and was directed to go and save Keilah (1 Samuel 23:1-5). David and his men successfully defended the town against the Philistines. However, when Saul heard that David was in Keilah, he planned to besiege the city and capture him. David again sought the Lord's guidance and learned that the people of Keilah would surrender him to Saul. As a result, David and his men left Keilah and continued to evade Saul (1 Samuel 23:7-13). Keilah is also mentioned in the genealogies of Judah (1 Chronicles 4:19) and in the context of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls during the time of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 3:17-18). The exact location of Keilah is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the western foothills of Judah, possibly at the site of Khirbet Qila, about 8 miles northwest of Hebron.",

During the religious reforms of King Josiah, the objects used for idol worship were burned and their ashes thrown into the Kidron Valley (2 Kings 23:4, 6, 12). The valley is also associated with the prophetic visions of Joel, who referred to it as the Valley of Jehoshaphat, where God would gather the nations for judgment (Joel 3:2, 12). In the New Testament, Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples to enter the Garden of Gethsemane on the night of his betrayal (John 18:1).

Joshua 13:19 confirms that Kiriathaim was allotted to the tribe of Reuben as part of their inheritance. However, the city later appears to have reverted to Moabite control, as the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel speak of God's judgment against Moab, specifically mentioning Kiriathaim (Jeremiah 48:1, 23; Ezekiel 25:9). The name \"Kiriathaim\" means \"double city\" or \"two cities,\" possibly indicating that it consisted of two parts or was a significant city in the region. The exact location of Kiriathaim is uncertain, but it is believed to be near the modern-day town of Quraiyat in Jordan.",

During the reign of King Amaziah, Lachish served as a refuge for the king when he fled from a conspiracy in Jerusalem (2 Kings 14:19; 2 Chronicles 25:27). In the time of King Hezekiah, the Assyrian king Sennacherib captured Lachish and used it as a base to send his officials to threaten Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:14, 17; 19:8; 2 Chronicles 32:9; Isaiah 36:2; 37:8). The city was one of the last fortified cities in Judah to fall to the Babylonians during the reign of Zedekiah (Jeremiah 34:7). After the Babylonian exile, Lachish was resettled by the people of Judah (Nehemiah 11:30).

He also sends greetings to the Laodicean church and instructs the Colossians to share his letter with them (Colossians 4:13, 15-16). In the book of Revelation, Laodicea is one of the seven churches addressed by Jesus Christ. The Laodicean church is rebuked for being lukewarm in their faith, neither hot nor cold, and for their self-sufficiency and spiritual complacency (Revelation 3:14-16). Despite their material wealth, Jesus declares them to be spiritually poor, blind, and naked, urging them to repent and seek true spiritual riches from Him (Revelation 3:17-18).",

The cedars of Lebanon were highly prized for their quality and were used in the construction of the Temple and other important buildings (1 Kings 5:6, 9, 14; 2 Chronicles 2:8, 16; Ezra 3:7). Lebanon is often used as a symbol of strength, prosperity, and beauty (Psalm 72:16; 92:12; Song of Solomon 4:11, 15; 5:15). It is also mentioned in the context of God's power and judgment (Psalm 29:5, 6; Isaiah 2:13; 10:34; Jeremiah 22:6, 23; Habakkuk 2:17). Lebanon is described as part of the Promised Land (Deuteronomy 1:7; 11:24; Joshua 1:4) and was a region where some Canaanite inhabitants remained (Judges 3:3). The beauty and majesty of Lebanon are used to illustrate the glory and splendor of the future kingdom of God (Isaiah 35:2; 60:13; Hosea 14:5-7).",

However, Jews from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and stirred up the crowd against them, leading to Paul being stoned and left for dead outside the city (Acts 14:19-20). Paul later returned to Lystra to strengthen the disciples (Acts 14:21). Timothy, a young disciple who accompanied Paul on his missionary journeys, was from Lystra (Acts 16:1-2).",

Paul wrote epistles to the Philippians and Thessalonians, which are included in the New Testament. Macedonia is also mentioned in connection with Paul's travel plans (Romans 15:26; 1 Corinthians 16:5; 2 Corinthians 1:16) and his co-workers, such as Sopater, Aristarchus, and Secundus (Acts 19:29; 20:4; 27:2).",

It was one of the cities fortified by King Rehoboam after the division of the kingdom (2 Chronicles 11:8). Mareshah is best known as the site of the battle between King Asa of Judah and Zerah the Ethiopian, who came against Judah with a vast army. Asa cried out to the Lord, and God granted him a decisive victory over the Ethiopians (2 Chronicles 14:9-15). The prophet Micah, who was from Mareshah (Micah 1:1), prophesied judgment against the city, declaring that a conqueror would come against it (Micah 1:15). King Jehoshaphat of Judah joined with Ahaziah of Israel in a shipping venture at Ezion-geber, but the ships were wrecked, as prophesied by Eliezer of Mareshah (2 Chronicles 20:35-37).",

Later, the Medes joined forces with the Persians to form the powerful Medo-Persian Empire. This empire, under the rule of Cyrus the Great, conquered Babylon in 539 BC (Daniel 5:28, 31). The Medes are mentioned in the book of Esther as one of the peoples under the rule of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) (Esther 1:3, 14, 18; 10:2). The Medes were also involved in the deportation of the Israelites from the northern kingdom (2 Kings 17:6; 18:11). The prophet Daniel served in the Medo-Persian court (Daniel 6:8, 12, 15; 9:1; 11:1) and interpreted the handwriting on the wall, which announced the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians (Daniel 5:28). Medes were among the peoples present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9).",

The Midianites lived in the desert regions of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in the area east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Moses fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian and married Zipporah, the daughter of Jethro, a Midianite priest (Exodus 2:15-22). Jethro later visited Moses and offered him wise counsel (Exodus 18:1-27). ¶During the time of the judges, the Midianites, along with the Amalekites and other eastern peoples, oppressed Israel for seven years (Judges 6:1-6). God raised up Gideon to deliver Israel from the Midianites (Judges 6:11-24). Gideon, with a small army of 300 men, defeated the Midianites and their allies, who were \"as numerous as locusts\" (Judges 7-8). ¶The Midianites were involved in the incident at Peor, where Israelite men were enticed into sexual immorality and idolatry (Numbers 25:1-18). As a result, God commanded Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites (Numbers 25:17-18; 31:1-54). ¶In later biblical history, the Midianites are mentioned as traders who bought Joseph from his brothers and sold him into slavery in Egypt (Genesis 37:28, 36). The prophet Isaiah refers to the defeat of Midian as a symbol of God's power to deliver his people (Isaiah 9:4; 10:26). The Midianites are also mentioned in the genealogy of Edom (Genesis 36:35; 1 Chronicles 1:46) and in a psalm calling for God's judgment on Israel's enemies (Psalm 83:9).",

The prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel also include Migdol in their prophecies against Egypt, indicating that it was a significant city (Jeremiah 46:14; Ezekiel 29:10; 30:6). ¶The exact location of the biblical Migdol is uncertain, but it is thought to be in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the present-day Suez Canal.

During his third journey, Paul stopped at Miletus on his way to Jerusalem and sent for the elders of the church in Ephesus to meet him there (Acts 20:15, 17). He delivered a farewell address to the Ephesian elders, warning them about false teachers and encouraging them to remain faithful to God (Acts 20:18-35). ¶In 2 Timothy 4:20, Paul mentions that he left Trophimus, one of his companions, ill at Miletus. This statement provides insight into the challenges and hardships faced by early Christian missionaries as they traveled and spread the gospel message. ¶Miletus was known for its wool industry and its intellectual and artistic achievements. It was the birthplace of several notable Greek philosophers, including Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who were among the first to seek rational explanations for natural phenomena.",

The construction of Millo was a significant undertaking, requiring a large workforce and resources (1 Kings 11:27). ¶During the reign of King Hezekiah, Millo was repaired and fortified as part of the preparations for the Assyrian invasion (2 Chronicles 32:5). The \"House of Millo\" is mentioned in connection with the coronation of King Joash (2 Kings 12:20), suggesting that it may have served as a royal residence or an important administrative center. ¶The exact location and nature of Millo are not clearly described in the Bible. Some scholars believe that it may have been a terraced structure or a landfill that supported the fortifications and buildings in the City of David, the oldest part of Jerusalem. Others suggest that it could have been a separate fortress or citadel within the city. Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem have uncovered remains of ancient fortifications and structures that may be associated with Millo, but the precise identification remains uncertain.",

Later, the prophet Samuel summoned the people to Mizpah for prayer, repentance, and deliverance from the Philistines (1 Samuel 7:5-7, 11-12, 16). Samuel also gathered the Israelites at Mizpah to appoint Saul as their first king (1 Samuel 10:17). ¶Mizpah was the hometown and burial place of Samuel (1 Samuel 1:19; 2:11; 7:17; 8:4; 15:34; 16:13; 19:18-23; 20:1; 25:1; 28:3). It was also the city of Joseph of Arimathea, the wealthy disciple who provided the tomb for Jesus' burial (Matthew 27:57; Mark 15:43; Luke 23:50-51; John 19:38). ¶During the divided monarchy, King Asa of Judah fortified Mizpah using materials from the dismantled fortifications of Ramah (1 Kings 15:22; 2 Chronicles 16:6). After the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, Mizpah served as the administrative center for the remnant of Judah under Gedaliah (2 Kings 25:23, 25; Jeremiah 40:6, 8, 10, 12-13, 15; 41:1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 16).",

The Moabites were a Semitic People from Moab, the son of Lot by his elder daughter (Gen. 19:37). ¶The Moabites first appear in the biblical record at the time of the Exodus. Balak, the king of Moab, feared the Israelites and hired Balaam to curse them (Num. 22-24). The Moabites worshipped the god Chemosh and induced some Israelites to join in their idolatrous sacrifices (Num. 25:1-2). ¶Throughout the time of the judges and early monarchy, the Moabites were in frequent conflict with Israel. King Saul fought against them (1 Sam. 14:47), and David subjugated them and made them tributaries (2 Sam. 8:2,12). After the division of the kingdom, the Moabites regained their independence. ¶During the reign of King Omri of Israel (c. 884-872 BC), who is mentioned in 1 Kings 16:23-28, Moabite lands were reconquered. However, about 40 years later, the Moabite king Mesha rebelled against Israel, as recorded on the famous Moabite Stone discovered in 1868 in Dibon (modern Dhiban, Jordan). ¶The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Amos all prophesied against Moab (Isa. 15-16, Jer. 48, Ezek. 25:8-11, Amos 2:1-2). After the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, some Jews took refuge in Moab (Jer. 40:11). Moab disappears as a nation from the historical record sometime during the Persian period.",

It was in the plains of Moab that the Israelites received instructions from Moses regarding the division of the land, the appointment of cities for the Levites and cities of refuge, and various laws and ordinances. Moses also delivered his final discourses to the Israelites in this location before his death on Mount Nebo, which overlooked the plains of Moab. The region was previously occupied by the Moabites, hence the name, but was conquered by the Amorites before the arrival of the Israelites.",

Jesus was often referred to as \"Jesus of Nazareth\" or \"the Nazarene\" (Mark 1:24; 10:47; Luke 18:37; 24:19; John 18:5, 7; 19:19; Acts 2:22; 10:38). ¶Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament or in other ancient literature, suggesting it was a small, relatively insignificant village. The Gospels record that Jesus grew up in Nazareth, preached in its synagogue (Luke 4:16-30), and was initially rejected by its inhabitants (Matt. 13:54-58; Mark 6:1-6; Luke 4:28-30). ¶In the first century, Nazareth had a negative reputation, as evidenced by Nathanael's question, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" (John 1:46). However, Jesus' upbringing in Nazareth fulfilled the prophecy that He would be called a Nazarene (Matt. 2:23), a term possibly derived from the Hebrew word \"netzer,\" meaning \"branch\" or \"shoot,\" and alluding to the Messiah (Isa. 11:1).",

The region is also mentioned in prophetic texts, often in the context of God's judgment or restoration (Isa. 21:1; 30:6; Jer. 13:19; 17:26; 32:44; 33:13; Obad. 1:19-20; Zech. 7:7).",

During the Israelites' bondage in Egypt, the Nile was the site of the miraculous plagues, such as the turning of the water into blood (Exod. 7:17-21) and the emergence of frogs from the river (Exod. 8:3-11). The Nile also played a role in the early life of Moses, who was placed in a basket among the reeds of the river as an infant (Exod. 2:3-5). ¶The prophets often used the Nile as a symbol of Egypt's power and pride, which would be brought low by God's judgment (Isa. 19:6-8; Jer. 46:7-8; Ezek. 29:3-9; 30:12; Amos 8:8; 9:5; Nah. 3:8; Zech. 10:11). The Nile was also a source of economic prosperity for Egypt, as it provided water for irrigation and served as a major transportation route (Isa. 23:3, 10).",

    "longDescription": "Nineveh was the capital city of the ancient Assyrian Empire, located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River in modern-day Iraq. It is first mentioned in the Bible as one of the cities founded by Nimrod, along with Rehoboth-Ir (Gen. 10:11-12). Nineveh became the capital of Assyria during the reign of Sennacherib (c. 705-681 BC) and was known for its size, power, and splendor (Jonah 3:3; 4:11). ¶In the book of Jonah, Nineveh is portrayed as a city of great wickedness, whose evil had come to God's attention (Jonah 1:2). Jonah was sent to preach against Nineveh, warning of its impending destruction. To Jonah's surprise, the people of Nineveh, from the king to the lowliest citizen, repented in response to his message (Jonah 3:5-9). As a result, God relented and spared the city (Jonah 3:10). ¶Despite this remarkable event, Nineveh remained a symbol of Assyrian power and a threat to Israel and Judah. The prophets Nahum and Zephaniah both foretold the eventual destruction of Nineveh as a judgment against Assyria's wickedness and oppression (Nah. 1:1; 2:8; 3:7; Zeph. 2:13). Nineveh fell to the Babylonians and Medes in 612 BC, marking the end of the Assyrian Empire. ¶In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the repentance of the Ninevites as a rebuke to his unbelieving generation (Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:30, 32).",

This marriage was arranged by Pharaoh and likely served to integrate Joseph into Egyptian society and religious life. ¶The city of On was a center of worship for the sun god Ra and was known for its temples and religious institutions. In the prophetic books, On is mentioned in the context of God's judgment against Egypt (Ezek. 30:17). Some translations and ancient versions (such as the Septuagint) also reference On in Isaiah 19:18, where it is called the \"City of Destruction\" or \"City of the Sun,\" depending on the interpretation of the Hebrew text.",

The name \"Paddan-aram\" means \"the plain of Aram\" or \"the field of Aram,\" referring to the area's geographical characteristics and its association with the Arameans. ¶Rebekah, Isaac's wife, was from Paddan-aram (Gen. 25:20). Later, Jacob fled to Paddan-aram to escape his brother Esau's anger and to find a wife from among his relatives (Gen. 28:2, 5-7). During his time there, Jacob married Leah and Rachel and fathered eleven of his twelve sons (Gen. 35:23-26). Jacob eventually left Paddan-aram to return to Canaan with his family and possessions (Gen. 31:18; 33:18). ¶The Arameans, who inhabited Paddan-aram, are mentioned as the ancestors of the Israelites in the context of God's deliverance and blessing (Deut. 26:5). The prophet Hosea also refers to Jacob's flight to Paddan-aram and his service for a wife (Hos. 12:12).",

It is mentioned several times in the New Testament, particularly in connection with Paul's missionary journeys. On the day of Pentecost, Jews from Pamphylia were among those present in Jerusalem who heard the apostles speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:10). ¶During Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas traveled to Perga in Pamphylia, where John Mark left them to return to Jerusalem (Acts 13:13). Later, Paul and Barnabas passed through Pamphylia again on their way to Antioch (Acts 14:24). In his second missionary journey, Paul chose not to take John Mark with him because he had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia (Acts 15:38). ¶The province of Pamphylia was known for its coastal cities, such as Perga and Attalia (modern-day Antalya), which served as important centers for trade and commerce. The region was also known for its rugged terrain, with the Taurus Mountains running through the northern part of the province.",

The proconsul, an intelligent man, summoned Paul and Barnabas and sought to hear the word of God. However, the sorcerer, also known as Elymas, opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith (Acts 13:8). ¶Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, rebuked Elymas and temporarily blinded him, demonstrating the power of God (Acts 13:9-11). As a result, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord (Acts 13:12). After this incident, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and traveled to Perga in Pamphylia (Acts 13:13).",

During the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Canaan, they camped in the wilderness of Paran after leaving the wilderness of Sinai (Num. 10:12; 12:16). It was from Paran that Moses sent the twelve spies to explore the land of Canaan (Num. 13:3, 26). ¶The wilderness of Paran was also associated with King David. After the death of Samuel, David went down to the wilderness of Paran (1 Sam. 25:1). Later, when Hadad the Edomite fled from King Solomon, he passed through Paran on his way to Egypt (1 Kgs. 11:18). ¶The exact boundaries of the wilderness of Paran are not clearly defined in the Bible, but it appears to have been a vast desert region in the central and northeastern parts of the Sinai Peninsula, bordered by the wilderness of Zin to the north and the Gulf of Aqaba to the south.",

It is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of Judean refugees who fled to Egypt after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC (Jer. 44:1, 15). The name \"Pathros\" is derived from the Egyptian word \"p-t-rsy,\" meaning \"the southern land.\" In Isaiah 11:11, Pathros is listed among the places from which God will recover the remnant of His people. Ezekiel prophesied that God would bring judgment upon Egypt and make the land of Pathros a desolation (Ezek. 29:14; 30:14). The biblical references to Pathros indicate that it was a distinct region within Egypt and that it had a significant Judean population during the exilic and post-exilic periods.",

While on Patmos, John received a series of visions from God, which he recorded in the Book of Revelation. These visions include messages to the seven churches of Asia Minor, prophetic imagery, and a glimpse of the heavenly throne room. The island of Patmos has since become a place of pilgrimage for Christians, with several monasteries and churches commemorating John's exile and the writing of Revelation.",

Historically, Pelusium served as a strategic frontier fortress and was known for its role in defending Egypt against foreign invasions. The city was also an important commercial center, situated at the crossroads of trade routes between Egypt, the Levant, and the Mediterranean world.

After the encounter, Jacob named the place Peniel, meaning \"face of God,\" saying, \"I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.\" The wrestling match marked a turning point in Jacob's life, as he received a new name, Israel, signifying his struggle with God and men (Gen. 32:28). ¶Later in the Bible, Penuel is mentioned as a city in the territory of Gad, east of the Jordan River. During the time of the judges, Gideon and his men pursued the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna to Penuel (Judg. 8:8-9). The men of Penuel refused to provide bread to Gideon's army, so Gideon vowed to tear down the tower of Penuel upon his return (Judg. 8:17). In the reign of King Jeroboam I of Israel, Penuel was one of the cities he fortified (1 Kgs. 12:25), possibly to secure his kingdom against the threat of Judah in the south.",

However, God intervened and caused Balaam to bless Israel instead (Num. 23:29-24:9). ¶Later, when the Israelites were camped in the plains of Moab, they began to engage in idolatry and sexual immorality with the Moabites (Num. 25:1-3). This incident became known as the \"matter of Peor\" (Num. 25:18; 31:16) and resulted in a plague that killed 24,000 Israelites (Num. 25:9). The Israelites' sin at Peor was remembered as a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of idolatry and foreign influences (Josh. 22:17; Ps. 106:28-29).

The name \"Perazim\" is derived from the Hebrew word \"perez,\" meaning \"to break through\" or \"to burst forth.\" The reference to Mount Perazim in Isaiah's prophecy alludes to David's victory over the Philistines at Baal-perazim (2 Sam. 5:20; 1 Chr. 14:11). In that battle, David acknowledged that the Lord had broken through his enemies like a bursting flood, hence the name \"Baal-perazim,\" meaning \"Lord of the bursting forth.\" ¶By using Mount Perazim as an example, Isaiah emphasizes that just as God granted David victory over the Philistines, He will also bring judgment upon those who oppose Him. The prophet warns that God's judgment will be swift and decisive, like His intervention on behalf of David. The mention of Mount Perazim in Isaiah's prophecy serves as a reminder of God's power and His willingness to act on behalf of His people while also bringing judgment upon the wicked.",

During the reign of King David, the Ark was being transported from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem on a new cart. When the oxen stumbled near the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark, touching it in the process. As a result, the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down for his irreverence (1 Chr. 13:9-10). ¶David was both afraid and angry because of this incident, and he named the place Perez-uzza. The event caused David to fear the Lord and question how he could bring the Ark to Jerusalem (1 Chr. 13:12). The Ark was then taken to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, where it remained for three months, bringing blessings to Obed-edom's household (1 Chr. 13:13-14). ¶The incident at Perez-uzza highlights the sacredness of the Ark of the Covenant and the importance of handling holy objects with reverence and according to divine instructions. It also demonstrates God's holiness and the consequences of irreverence or disobedience.",

Paul and Barnabas then traveled north to Antioch in Pisidia, where they preached in the synagogue (Acts 13:14). On their return journey, Paul and Barnabas passed through Perga again, preaching the gospel to the city before sailing back to Antioch in Syria (Acts 14:25). Although the biblical account does not provide extensive details about their ministry in Perga, it is clear that the city was an important stop on Paul's missionary itinerary and played a role in the spread of Christianity in the region.",

Pergamum is described as the place where \"Satan's throne\" is located (Rev. 2:13), possibly referring to the city's numerous pagan temples and its status as a center of emperor worship. Despite the challenges and temptations they faced, the Christians in Pergamum are encouraged to repent and remain faithful, with the promise of receiving hidden manna and a new name (Rev. 2:16-17).",

The Babylonian Empire, which had destroyed Jerusalem and taken the Jews into captivity, fell to the Persians under Cyrus the Great (2 Chr. 36:20, 22-23; Ezra 1:1-2). Cyrus issued a decree allowing the exiled Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-4). The Persian kings Darius I and Artaxerxes I also played significant roles in supporting the rebuilding efforts (Ezra 4:24; 6:14). ¶The book of Esther is set in the Persian capital of Susa during the reign of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), and it describes how Esther, a Jewish woman, became queen and saved her people from a plot to destroy them (Esther 1:3, 14, 18; 10:2). The prophets Ezekiel and Daniel also mention Persia in their visions and prophecies (Ezek. 27:10; 38:5; Dan. 8:20; 10:1, 13, 20; 11:2). Persia is portrayed as a powerful empire that God used to fulfill His purposes for His people, even though the Persians themselves were not followers of the God of Israel.",

When the Israelites were camped in the plains of Moab, Balak sent messengers to Pethor to summon Balaam, offering him payment to curse Israel (Num. 22:5-7). Despite God's initial warning not to go with the men, Balaam eventually set out on his donkey to meet with Balak (Num. 22:21). Along the way, the Angel of the Lord opposed Balaam, and his donkey spoke to him, revealing the presence of the Angel (Num. 22:22-35). Balaam ultimately blessed Israel instead of cursing them, following God's command (Num. 23-24). The location of Pethor is not precisely known, but its association with the Euphrates River suggests that it was situated in the upper Mesopotamian region, possibly in the area of modern-day Syria or Iraq.",

Naaman was initially angry at this suggestion, exclaiming, \"Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?\" (2 Kgs. 5:12). However, after being persuaded by his servants, Naaman followed Elisha's instructions and was healed of his leprosy (2 Kgs. 5:13-14). The Pharpar River, which still exists today, flows from the Anti-Lebanon mountains and runs through the city of Damascus before emptying into a lake east of the city. Naaman's initial reluctance to wash in the Jordan highlights the pride and prejudice that can hinder people from experiencing God's healing and blessing.",

The city is first mentioned in the New Testament in connection with Paul's second missionary journey (Acts 16:12). In Philippi, Paul and his companions met a group of women praying by the river, including Lydia, a merchant who became the first convert in Europe (Acts 16:13-15). However, Paul and Silas were soon imprisoned after casting out a spirit of divination from a slave girl (Acts 16:16-24). While in prison, they experienced a miraculous earthquake that led to the conversion of the jailer and his household (Acts 16:25-34). ¶Paul visited Philippi again on his third missionary journey (Acts 20:6) and later wrote a letter to the church, known as the Epistle to the Philippians. In this letter, Paul expresses his deep affection for the Philippian believers and thanks them for their support and partnership in the gospel (Phil. 1:3-7; 4:15-19). He also encourages them to remain united, humble, and joyful in the face of adversity (Phil. 1:27-2:18; 4:4-7). The church in Philippi is portrayed as a faithful and generous community, supporting Paul's ministry even in his imprisonment (Phil. 4:10-20).",

    "longDescription": "The Philistines were an ancient people who lived in the coastal plain of Canaan, primarily in the region known as Philistia, which corresponds to the modern-day Gaza Strip and the southern coast of Israel. They are first mentioned in the Bible during the time of Abraham (Gen. 21:32, 34) and Isaac (Gen. 26:1, 8, 14-15, 18). The Philistines were not part of the original inhabitants of Canaan and are believed to have migrated from the Aegean region, possibly as part of the Sea Peoples' movement in the 12th century BC. ¶Throughout the period of the judges and the early monarchy, the Philistines were a constant threat to the Israelites. They oppressed Israel for 40 years until Samson began to deliver them (Judg. 13:1, 5). Samson's encounters with the Philistines, including his marriage to a Philistine woman and his final act of bringing down the temple of Dagon, are recorded in Judges 14-16. During the time of Samuel, the Philistines defeated Israel and captured the Ark of the Covenant (1 Sam. 4). They were later forced to return the Ark after experiencing plagues (1 Sam. 5-6). ¶The Philistines continued to be a significant enemy during the reigns of Saul and David. The famous battle between David and the Philistine giant Goliath took place during this time (1 Sam. 17). David fought against the Philistines throughout his reign (2 Sam. 5; 8:1, 12; 21; 23), and they remained a threat until the later years of the divided monarchy (2 Kgs. 18:8; 2 Chr. 26:6-7; 28:18). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, and Zephaniah all mention the Philistines in their oracles, often pronouncing judgment against them (Isa. 14:29-31; Jer. 47; Ezek. 25:15-17; Amos 1:8; Zeph. 2:5). ¶The Philistines were known for their advanced iron technology, their distinctive pottery, and their religious practices, which included the worship of deities such as Dagon, Ashtoreth, and Baal-Zebub.

After the persecution that arose following Stephen's death, some believers traveled as far as Phoenicia, preaching the gospel (Acts 11:19). Later, when Paul and Barnabas were returning from the Jerusalem Council, they passed through Phoenicia, bringing joy to the believers there (Acts 15:3). During Paul's final journey to Jerusalem, he sailed to Tyre, a city in Phoenicia, where he stayed with disciples for seven days (Acts 21:2-4). Although the Phoenicians are not mentioned extensively in the Bible, their region played a role in the spread of the gospel in the early church era.",

The majority decided to attempt the journey to Phoenix, as it was considered a more suitable harbor to winter in (Acts 27:12). However, before they could reach Phoenix, a violent wind drove the ship off course, ultimately leading to its shipwreck on the island of Malta (Acts 27:13-44). The exact location of Phoenix is not certain, but it is believed to have been situated on the southwestern coast of Crete, possibly near the modern-day town of Loutro or the village of Phiniki.",

During Paul's second missionary journey, he and his companions traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, where they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in the province of Asia (Acts 16:6). On his third missionary journey, Paul passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia again, strengthening the disciples (Acts 18:23). In the closing of Paul's first letter to Timothy, he mentions that some have wandered from the faith, including Phygelus and Hermogenes, who were likely from Phrygia (2 Tim. 1:15). The mention of Phrygia in these passages highlights the spread of Christianity beyond Judea and the importance of the region in the early church's growth.",

This judgment is part of a larger oracle against Egypt, in which God declares that He will bring punishment upon the land for its idolatry and opposition to His people.

The Egyptians, led by Pharaoh, pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they were camped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon (Exod. 14:9). It was at this location that God instructed Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea, causing the waters to divide and allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground (Exod. 14:15-16, 21-22). The Egyptians pursued them into the sea, but God brought the waters back upon them, drowning Pharaoh's entire army (Exod. 14:23-28). The Israelites' journey from Pi-hahiroth is also mentioned in the list of their encampments in Numbers 33:7-8. The exact location of Pi-hahiroth is uncertain, but it was evidently near the Red Sea, and its mention in the Exodus narrative highlights God's power and deliverance on behalf of His people.",

He judged Israel for eight years and was buried in Pirathon (Judg. 12:14-15). Two of David's mighty men, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Hiddai (or Hurai) of the brooks of Gaash, were also from Pirathon (2 Sam. 23:30; 1 Chr. 11:31; 27:14). Benaiah, in particular, was a highly esteemed warrior who commanded the Cherethites and Pelethites, and later supported Solomon's claim to the throne (2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kgs. 1:8, 38, 44). The repeated mention of Pirathon as the hometown of these significant figures suggests that it was a place of some importance during the period of the judges and the early monarchy.",

During the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, they camped in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Moab, where Moses delivered his final instructions and warnings to the people (Deut. 4:44-46). God instructed Moses to go up to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, and view the land of Canaan, which He was giving to the Israelites (Deut. 3:27; 34:1). From this vantage point, Moses was able to see the Promised Land, from Gilead to Dan, and all the lands of Naphtali, Ephraim, Manasseh, Judah, and the Negev (Deut. 34:1-3). After viewing the land, Moses died there in the land of Moab, and God buried him in a valley opposite Beth-peor (Deut. 34:5-6). The slopes of Pisgah are also mentioned as part of the territory conquered by the Israelites and allocated to the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Num. 21:20; Josh. 12:3; 13:20). The significance of Pisgah lies in its association with Moses' final moments and its panoramic view of the Promised Land, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promise to His people.",

Pishon is said to wind through the entire land of Havilah, a region known for its abundance of gold, bdellium (a fragrant resin), and onyx stone (Gen. 2:11-12). The name \"Pishon\" is thought to derive from the Hebrew root \"puwsh,\" meaning \"to scatter, spread, or spring forward,\" possibly indicating that the river originated from a spring and formed a delta. Despite attempts to identify Pishon with various modern-day rivers, such as the Nile, Indus, or Ganges, its exact location remains unknown, as the geography described in the Eden account is difficult to reconcile with the current landscape. Some scholars suggest that the Pishon and the other rivers of Eden may have symbolic or allegorical significance, representing the life-giving power and abundance that flowed from God's presence in the garden.",

Paul and Barnabas traveled to Antioch in Pisidia, where they preached in the synagogue on the Sabbath (Acts 13:14-41). Many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, but the jealous Jewish leaders stirred up persecution against them, forcing them to leave the city (Acts 13:42-52). Despite the opposition, the word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region (Acts 13:49). On their return journey, Paul and Barnabas passed through Pisidia again, strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain faithful (Acts 14:21-23).

The exact location of Pithom is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the eastern Nile Delta region, possibly near the modern-day city of Tell el-Maskhuta. The name \"Pithom\" is thought to be derived from the Egyptian \"Per-Atum,\" meaning \"House of Atum,\" referring to the Egyptian god Atum.

Aquila, a Jew from Pontus, and his wife Priscilla, were tentmakers who had been expelled from Rome by Emperor Claudius and met Paul in Corinth (Acts 18:2). They became close friends and co-workers of Paul, hosting a church in their home (1 Cor. 16:19). The apostle Peter addressed his first epistle to the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus and other regions of Asia Minor (1 Pet. 1:1), indicating the presence of Christian believers in the area.

The Lord instructed Jeremiah to go to the Potsherd Gate, which was near the entrance of the Valley of Ben Hinnom (or Gehenna), and proclaim a message of judgment against the people of Judah (Jer. 19:1-2). The Valley of Ben Hinnom was notorious for the practice of child sacrifice to the pagan god Molech (Jer. 32:35). Jeremiah was told to shatter an earthenware jar in front of the elders and priests as a symbol of the impending destruction of Jerusalem and its people (Jer. 19:10-11). The Potsherd Gate likely received its name from the fragments of broken pottery (potsherds) that were discarded in the nearby valley. The gate's location near the Valley of Ben Hinnom, a place associated with idolatry and judgment, underscores the severity of Jeremiah's prophetic message and the consequences of Judah's unfaithfulness to God.",

However, this identification remains speculative due to the lack of conclusive archaeological evidence.

After sailing from Malta, where they had been shipwrecked, Paul and his companions arrived at Syracuse and then proceeded to Rhegium. From there, they sailed to Puteoli, where they found some Christian brothers and stayed with them for seven days (Acts 28:13-14). Puteoli was a significant harbor and commercial center, serving as a gateway to Rome. It was also a major hub for the grain trade from Egypt, which was vital for supplying food to the populous city of Rome. The presence of a Christian community in Puteoli indicates the spread of the gospel in Italy, even before Paul's arrival in Rome. Paul's stay in Puteoli for a week suggests that he had the opportunity to fellowship with and encourage the local believers before continuing his journey to Rome, where he would await trial before Caesar.",

The Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Raamses as store cities for Pharaoh. The construction of these cities was part of the Egyptians' plan to subdue the growing Israelite population and prevent them from joining forces with Egypt's enemies in case of war (Exod. 1:9-10). The exact location of Raamses is debated, but it is generally associated with the city of Pi-Ramesses (House of Ramesses), the capital of Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC. Pi-Ramesses was located in the eastern Nile Delta, near the modern-day city of Qantir. The name \"Raamses\" is thought to be derived from the name of Pharaoh Ramesses II, who was known for his extensive building projects. The mention of Raamses in the book of Exodus serves to illustrate the harsh conditions and oppression experienced by the Israelites in Egypt, setting the stage for God's miraculous deliverance of His people.",

It is mentioned several times in the Bible in connection with various events and prophecies. During the period of the judges, Deborah, a prophetess and judge, held court between Ramah and Bethel (Judg. 4:5). In the story of the Levite and his concubine, the Levite planned to spend the night in Ramah before the tragic events in Gibeah (Judg. 19:13). Later, during the reign of King Baasha of Israel, he fortified Ramah to prevent people from going to or coming from Judah (1 Kgs. 15:17, 21-22; 2 Chr. 16:1, 5-6). The town was also mentioned in the context of the return of the exiles from Babylon (Ezra 2:26; Neh. 7:30) and as one of the settlements where the Benjamites lived after the exile (Neh. 11:33). The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Hosea mentioned Ramah in their prophecies, often in connection with judgment or mourning (Isa. 10:29; Jer. 31:15; 40:1; Hos. 5:8). In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel quotes Jeremiah's prophecy about Rachel weeping for her children in Ramah, applying it to Herod's massacre of the infants in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:18). The frequent mention of Ramah in various contexts highlights its importance as a town in the territory of Benjamin and its association with significant events in Israel's history.",

The men of Judah, fearing Philistine reprisal, bound Samson and handed him over to the Philistines. However, when the Philistines came to capture him, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he broke free from his bonds. He then found a fresh jawbone of a donkey and used it to strike down a thousand Philistines (Judg. 15:14-16). The place where this event occurred was called Ramath-lehi, which means \"hill of the jawbone\" or \"jawbone height\" (Judg. 15:17). The name served as a reminder of Samson's remarkable feat and God's empowerment in his life. The story of Samson at Ramath-lehi highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during the period of the judges and demonstrates God's power to deliver His people through unlikely means.",

Ramoth-gilead was the site of several battles between Israel and Aram (1 Ki. 22; 2 Ki. 8-9; 2 Ch. 18; 22). It is also mentioned in the story of Israel (or 'Jacob') and Laban, who made a covenant there and named the place Galeed and Mizpah (Gen. 31:47-49). The exact location is uncertain, but it was likely an important fortress city in Gilead guarding a key trade route.",

This event is remembered as a great act of divine deliverance (Jos. 2:10; Neh. 9:9; Psa. 106:7-9; 136:13-15). The Red Sea also marked the southern border of the Promised Land (Exo. 23:31). King Solomon later built a fleet of ships on the Red Sea at Ezion-geber (1 Ki. 9:26). The Hebrew name Yam Suph means \"Sea of Reeds\", so the body of water was likely one of the shallow lakes along Egypt's eastern border rather than the main body of the Red Sea.

In the ensuing battle, the Benjamites were defeated, and the survivors escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed for four months (Jdg. 20:45, 47). Later, the Israelites sent a peace delegation to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon, urging them to return (Jdg. 21:13). The exact location of the rock of Rimmon is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem.",

It was the seat of power for the vast empire that ruled over much of the known world during the time of Jesus and the early church.

He spent at least two years under house arrest in Rome, during which time he wrote several epistles (Acts 28:30-31; Eph. 6:20; Phil. 1:13; Col. 4:18; Philem. 1:1). Paul also expressed his desire to visit the church in Rome (Acts 19:21; Rom. 1:10-15; 15:23-24). The church in Rome, though not founded by Paul, was well-established and included both Jewish and Gentile believers (Acts 28:17-28; Rom. 1:7; 16:3-16). Rome was also the place where Emperor Claudius had expelled the Jews, including Aquila and Priscilla, leading them to settle in Corinth (Acts 18:2). Tradition holds that both Paul and Peter were martyred in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero. The city of Rome, with its political and cultural significance, served as a strategic center for the spread of the gospel and the growth of the early church.",

During Paul's voyage to Rome as a prisoner, the ship he was on sailed along the southern coast of Crete, opposite Salmone (Acts 27:7). This reference provides a geographical marker for the route taken by the ship before it encountered difficult sailing conditions and eventually shipwrecked on the island of Malta (Acts 27:8-44). Salmone is believed to be the modern-day Cape Sidero, the northeastern extremity of Crete, which extends into the Mediterranean Sea. The mention of Salmone in Acts helps to trace the path of Paul's journey and highlights the challenges faced by early Christian missionaries as they traveled throughout the Roman Empire.",

It is also mentioned in the context of historical events, such as the battle between the kings of the region and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 14:3) and the extent of Jeroboam II's territorial expansion (2 Ki. 14:25). The Salt Sea's unique characteristics, including its low elevation and high salinity, have made it a significant feature in the biblical landscape.",

Later, in 2 Kings 14:7 and 2 Chronicles 25:11, King Amaziah of Judah is said to have killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. The exact location of the Salt Valley is uncertain, but it was likely situated near the Dead Sea, possibly in the Arabah region south of the Dead Sea. The valley's name suggests an area with high salt content, which is characteristic of the Dead Sea region. Psalm 60, which is attributed to David, also mentions the Salt Valley in the context of military victories (Psa. 60:1).

After the Assyrian conquest, the region of Samaria was repopulated with people from various parts of the Assyrian Empire (2 Ki. 17:24), who intermarried with the remaining Israelites and became known as Samaritans. ¶The Samaritans developed their own religious practices, which combined elements of Israelite tradition with foreign customs (2 Ki. 17:26-28). They worshipped at Mount Gerizim instead of Jerusalem (Jhn. 4:20) and accepted only the first five books of the Bible as authoritative. ¶In the New Testament, Jesus encountered a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well (Jhn. 4:7-26) and used a Samaritan as an example of compassion in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luk. 10:33). The early church spread to Samaria through the ministry of Philip (Acts 8:5-25), and the apostles Peter and John later visited the region (Acts 8:14-17). ¶Throughout the Bible, Samaria and the Samaritans are often portrayed as being in tension with the Jews due to religious and cultural differences (Jhn. 4:9; 8:48). However, Jesus and the early church demonstrated that the gospel was meant for all people, including the Samaritans.",

In Isaiah 43:3, God promises to give Egypt, Cush, and Seba as a ransom for Israel, indicating their value and the lengths to which God will go to redeem His people. ¶The exact location of Seba is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of Cush (modern-day Sudan) or the Arabian Peninsula. Some scholars suggest that Seba may have been a part of the kingdom of Sheba (modern-day Yemen), known for its wealth and trade in spices, gold, and precious stones. ¶The biblical references to Seba highlight the universal acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the submission of nations to His anointed king. The inclusion of Seba in prophetic and poetic texts also underscores the far-reaching impact of God's redemptive plan and the ultimate gathering of all nations to worship Him.",

This suggests that the Second Quarter was a significant residential area within the city. ¶The exact location and boundaries of the Second Quarter are not specified in the Bible.

It is often used interchangeably with Edom to refer to the nation that emerged from Esau's lineage (Gen. 36:30; Num. 24:18; Deut. 2:4, 8, 29; Josh. 24:4). ¶The region of Seir played a role in several biblical events. It was the location where the kings of the East fought against the Horites (Gen. 14:6). Moses and the Israelites passed through Seir during their wilderness wanderings, but were instructed not to provoke the Edomites to war (Deut. 1:44; 2:4, 8). Later, during the divided monarchy, King Amaziah of Judah defeated the Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela, a stronghold in Seir (2 Chr. 25:11, 14). ¶The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel also mention Seir in their oracles, often in the context of God's judgment against Edom (Isa. 21:11; Ezek. 25:8). The region's rugged terrain and strategic location made it a formidable challenge for invading armies and a symbol of Edom's strength and pride.",

    "longDescription": "Mount Seir is a specific mountain or mountainous region within the larger area of Seir, which was inhabited by the Edomites. It is mentioned several times in the Bible, often in the context of the Israelites' interactions with the Edomites during their wilderness wanderings and later in their history. ¶Mount Seir is first mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy, where it is described as an eleven-day journey from Horeb (Sinai) by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea (Deut. 1:2). The Israelites were instructed to turn away from Mount Seir and pass through the territory of their brothers, the descendants of Esau, without provoking them (Deut. 2:1, 5). ¶During the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites came against Judah by way of Mount Seir (2 Chr. 20:10, 22, 23). However, God caused these enemies to turn against each other, resulting in their defeat and the deliverance of Judah. ¶The prophet Ezekiel also delivered oracles against Mount Seir, declaring God's judgment against the Edomites for their hostility towards Israel (Ezek. 35:2, 3, 7, 15). This judgment would result in the desolation of Mount Seir and the recognition of God's sovereignty. ¶The specific location of Mount Seir within the region of Seir is not clearly defined in the Bible. However, its association with the Edomites and its strategic importance in military campaigns suggest that it was a prominent and well-fortified area within the mountainous region of Seir.",

Sela is believed to be the ancient name for the city of Petra, the capital of the Nabataean kingdom, which was carved into the rock faces of the surrounding mountains. The Nabataeans, who inhabited the area after the Edomites, further developed the city and its impressive rock-cut architecture.

The name \"Seneh\" means \"thorny\" or \"pointed\" in Hebrew, suggesting that the crag was sharp and difficult to traverse. The passage describes the challenging terrain, with cliffs on both sides of the pass, emphasizing the bravery and faith of Jonathan and his companion as they ventured into enemy territory. Their successful attack on the Philistines, despite the odds, demonstrated their trust in God and inspired the Israelites to pursue and defeat the Philistine army.",

The church in Sardis is rebuked for its spiritual deadness and is called to repent and strengthen what remains (Rev. 3:1-3). However, there were a few faithful believers in Sardis who had not defiled their garments, and they are promised to walk with Jesus in white (Rev. 3:4). ¶If Sepharad and Sardis are indeed the same place, the reference in Obadiah suggests that a Jewish community existed there, possibly as a result of the Babylonian exile.

The mention of Shaalim in this narrative serves to highlight the extent of Saul's search for the donkeys and the various regions he traversed before encountering the prophet Samuel, who would anoint him as the first king of Israel.

The town is also referenced in the account of David's victory over Goliath and the Philistines (1 Sam. 17). After the Philistines were defeated at Socoh, they retreated down the valley of Elah (modern Wadi es-Sant) toward Gath and Ekron, passing by Shaaraim (1 Sam. 17:52). Some scholars suggest that the \"two gates\" mentioned in this passage may refer to the Philistine strongholds of Gath and Ekron themselves, rather than a specific town. The exact location of Shaaraim is uncertain, but it has been tentatively identified with Tell Zakariya or Khirbet Sa'ireh, both located in the Shephelah region. However, these identifications remain speculative due to limited archaeological evidence.",

During the reign of King David, Sharon was known for its herds of cattle, overseen by Shitrai the Sharonite (1 Chr. 27:29). The prophet Isaiah used Sharon as a symbol of fruitfulness and blessing, contrasting it with the desolation brought by God's judgment (Isa. 33:9; 65:10). In the New Testament, the plain of Sharon is mentioned in connection with the ministry of the apostle Peter, who healed Aeneas in Lydda and proclaimed the gospel throughout the region (Acts 9:35). The fertile soil and moderate climate of Sharon made it a prosperous agricultural area, supporting a variety of crops and livestock. Its location along the coastal trade routes also contributed to its economic significance in ancient Israel.",

This Sharon is distinct from the well-known coastal plain of Sharon west of the Jordan. The exact location and extent of this eastern Sharon are not specified in the biblical text. It likely refers to a fertile grazing area within the territory of Gad, suitable for the tribe's extensive herds and flocks.

It was one of the towns given to Simeon when the tribe received an inheritance within Judah's allotment (Josh. 19:1-9). The exact location of Sharuhen is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the semi-arid region south of Hebron. Some scholars propose identifying it with Tell el-Far'ah, a site about 12 miles south of Gaza, where excavations have revealed remains from the Middle Bronze Age and later periods. However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. The mention of Sharuhen in the lists of towns allotted to Simeon and Judah highlights the close relationship between the two tribes and the integration of Simeon's territory within Judah's borders.",

    "longDescription": "Sheba, also known as the South, was an ancient kingdom located in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula, in modern-day Yemen. It was renowned for its wealth, derived from its control of the spice and incense trade routes. The Bible mentions Sheba in connection with its trade in gold, spices, precious stones, and incense (1 Ki. 10:2, 10; 2 Chr. 9:1, 9; Ps. 72:15; Isa. 60:6; Jer. 6:20; Ezek. 27:22). ¶The most famous biblical account involving Sheba is the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon (1 Ki. 10:1-13; 2 Chr. 9:1-12). Intrigued by reports of Solomon's wisdom and prosperity, the queen journeyed to Jerusalem with a great caravan, bearing gifts of gold, spices, and precious stones. She tested Solomon with hard questions and was impressed by his wisdom and the splendor of his court. The queen praised Solomon and his God, acknowledging the divine source of his wisdom and success. ¶Sheba is also mentioned in prophetic and poetic texts, often as a symbol of distant and exotic lands (Ps. 72:10; Isa. 60:6; Ezek. 38:13). In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Queen of the South (Sheba) as one who will rise up in judgment against those who reject His message, emphasizing her recognition of wisdom and truth (Luke 11:31). ¶The kingdom of Sheba played a significant role in the trade networks of the ancient Near East, and its mention in the Bible attests to its fame and influence during the biblical period.",

After the conquest of Jericho, the Israelites attacked the city of Ai but were defeated because of Achan's sin of taking devoted things from Jericho. As a result, the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six Israelites and pursued them from the city gate as far as Shebarim. ¶The exact location of Shebarim is unknown, but it was likely a place near Ai where the terrain allowed the defenders to overtake the fleeing Israelites. The name \"Shebarim\" means \"the breaks\" or \"the quarries,\" possibly indicating a rocky or broken landscape that made escape difficult. ¶The mention of Shebarim in this narrative highlights the consequences of disobedience and sin within the Israelite camp. Achan's violation of God's command led to defeat and humiliation at the hands of a smaller enemy force. The pursuit of the Israelites to Shebarim underscores the extent of their defeat and the vulnerability caused by their failure to uphold God's standards of holiness.",

    "longDescription": "Shechem was an important city in central Canaan, located in the hill country between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Bible, often in connection with significant events in Israel's history. ¶Shechem first appears in the account of Abraham's journey to Canaan, where he built an altar to the Lord (Gen. 12:6-7). Later, Israel (or 'Jacob') settled near Shechem and purchased a piece of land, setting up an altar there (Gen. 33:18-20). However, the city also became the site of violence when Jacob's daughter Dinah was violated by Shechem, the son of Hamor, leading to the massacre of the city's male inhabitants by Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi (Gen. 34). ¶During the conquest of Canaan, Shechem was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim and designated as a city of refuge (Josh. 20:7; 21:21). Joshua gathered the tribes at Shechem to renew the covenant and set up a stone of remembrance (Josh. 24:1, 25-26). The city later became the site of Abimelech's short-lived kingdom (Judg. 9) and was rebuilt by Jeroboam as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel (1 Ki. 12:25). ¶Shechem held religious significance, as evidenced by the blessings and curses pronounced from Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33). The city is also mentioned in the Psalms as a symbol of God's dominion over Israel (Ps. 60:6; 108:7). ¶In the New Testament, Stephen's speech before the Sanhedrin mentions Shechem as the burial place of Jacob and his sons (Acts 7:16), although this differs from the Old Testament account of their burial at Hebron (Gen. 49:29-33; 50:13). ¶Shechem's location at the crossroads of major trade routes contributed to its strategic and economic importance. The city's history, marked by both sacred events and periods of violence, reflects the complex dynamics of Israelite settlement and inter-tribal relations in Canaan.",

The high priest Eliashib and his fellow priests took responsibility for rebuilding this gate (Nehemiah 3:1), making it the first structure mentioned in Nehemiah's systematic description of the wall's reconstruction. ¶ The gate marked a significant point in Jerusalem's defensive walls. It appears at both the beginning and end of Nehemiah's description of the wall repairs (Nehemiah 3:1, 32), suggesting it may have been a starting and ending point for the reconstruction project. During the dedication of the rebuilt walls, one of the thanksgiving processions passed through the Sheep Gate (Nehemiah 12:39). ¶ In the New Testament, the gate is mentioned indirectly in connection with the Pool of Bethesda, which was located near the Sheep Gate (John 5:2). This reference helps establish its location in the northeastern section of Jerusalem. ¶ The gate probably derived its name from its use as an entrance point for sheep being brought to the nearby Temple for sacrifice, though this is not explicitly stated in Scripture. ¶ Probably corresponds to the modern location near the Lion's Gate (also called St. Stephen's Gate) in Jerusalem's Old City walls.",

In the time of Nehemiah, the wall of Jerusalem was repaired near the Pool of Shelah (Neh. 3:15), and Nehemiah himself inspected the walls by the King's Pool (Neh. 2:14). The prophet Isaiah used the gently flowing waters of Shiloah as a metaphor for the calm and trust in God, in contrast to the mighty waters of the Euphrates, symbolizing the Assyrian threat (Isa. 8:6). ¶In the New Testament, Jesus healed a man born blind by sending him to wash in the Pool of Siloam (John 9:7, 11). This miracle not only demonstrated Jesus' power but also served as a spiritual lesson about faith and the true identity of the Messiah. The Gospel of Luke also records an incident where eighteen people were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them (Luke 13:4), using this event to teach about the need for repentance. ¶The Pool of Siloam has been identified with the archaeological site known as the Siloam Pool, which was discovered in 2004. Excavations have revealed a large pool from the Second Temple period, consistent with the biblical descriptions and historical accounts of the site.",

During the conquest of Canaan, Joshua and the Israelites fought against the kings of the Shephelah (Josh. 9:1; 10:40; 11:2, 16; 12:8). The region was allotted to the tribes of Judah and Dan (Josh. 15:33; Judg. 1:9). ¶The Shephelah was renowned for its fertility and agricultural productivity. It was a region where wheat, barley, grapes, and olives were cultivated (1 Chr. 27:28; 2 Chr. 26:10). The abundance of sycamore and cedar trees in the Shephelah was compared to the abundance of stones during Solomon's reign (1 Ki. 10:27; 2 Chr. 1:15; 9:27). ¶The prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah mention the Shephelah in their prophecies, highlighting its importance and the restoration of its cities and villages (Jer. 17:26; 32:44; 33:13; Zech. 7:7). The prophet Obadiah also foretells that the people of the Shephelah will possess the fields of Ephraim and Samaria (Obad. 1:19). ¶The Shephelah played a significant role in the history of ancient Israel, serving as a region of strategic, agricultural, and prophetic importance. Its fertile valleys and proximity to major trade routes made it a valuable and contested area throughout the biblical period.",

    "longDescription": "Shiloh was an important religious center and assembly point for the Israelites during the period of the judges. After the conquest of Canaan, the tabernacle was set up at Shiloh, and it served as the central place of worship for the nation (Josh. 18:1; 19:51). It was at Shiloh that the land was allotted to the tribes of Israel (Josh. 18:8-10; 21:2) and where the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh were dismissed to their territories east of the Jordan (Josh. 22:9, 12). ¶During the time of the judges, Shiloh continued to be a significant religious site. The tabernacle remained at Shiloh throughout this period (Judg. 18:31), and annual festivals were held there (Judg. 21:19, 21). It was at Shiloh that Hannah prayed for a son and dedicated Samuel to the Lord's service (1 Sam. 1:3, 9, 24). The priest Eli and his sons ministered at the tabernacle in Shiloh (1 Sam. 2:14; 3:21; 4:3, 4, 12), and the Ark of the Covenant was kept there until it was captured by the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:3, 4). ¶Shiloh's importance declined after the Ark was taken and the tabernacle was destroyed (Ps. 78:60; Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9). The prophet Ahijah, who prophesied the division of the kingdom, was from Shiloh (1 Ki. 11:29; 14:2, 4). The town was eventually destroyed, and its ruins served as a warning against disobedience to God (Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6, 9). ¶Shiloh's significance in the biblical narrative lies in its role as a religious and political center during the formative years of Israel's history. Its central location in the hill country of Ephraim made it a convenient meeting place for the tribes and a symbol of their unity under the worship of the Lord.",

The king of Shimron-meron is listed among those who joined forces with Jabin, king of Hazor, to oppose Joshua and the Israelites. ¶In the subsequent battle, Joshua and the Israelites defeated the Canaanite coalition, including the king of Shimron-meron (Josh. 12:20). The city of Shimron was later allotted to the tribe of Zebulun as part of their inheritance in the Promised Land (Josh. 19:15). ¶The exact location of Shimron is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the northern part of Canaan, in the region later known as Galilee. Some scholars propose identifying Shimron with the archaeological site of Tel Shimron, located in the Jezreel Valley, near the modern-day town of Timrat. However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. ¶The mention of Shimron in the conquest narratives highlights the extent of the Canaanite opposition to Israel's entrance into the Promised Land and the subsequent victory of Joshua and the Israelites under God's guidance. The allotment of Shimron to the tribe of Zebulun underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to His people as an inheritance.",

This region became historically significant immediately after the Flood when people migrated to a plain in Shinar and built the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:2). ¶ The area was ruled by powerful kings from an early period. Amraphel, king of Shinar, appears among the coalition of kings who fought against the cities of the plain during Abraham's time (Genesis 14:1,9). This demonstrates the region's significant political influence in the ancient Near East. ¶ Shinar's wealth and craftsmanship were renowned. During the conquest of Canaan, Achan coveted and stole a beautiful robe from Shinar among other valuable items (Joshua 7:21). The quality of its goods made them highly desirable as plunder. ¶ The region maintained its importance throughout biblical history. Isaiah mentioned Shinar among the places from which God would recover the remnant of His people (Isaiah 11:11). During the Babylonian exile, King Nebuchadnezzar took vessels from Jerusalem's temple to \"the land of Shinar,\" to the house of his god (Daniel 1:2). ¶ In a prophetic vision, Zechariah saw wickedness being transported to Shinar, where a house would be built for it (Zechariah 5:11), suggesting the region's enduring association with rebellion against God. ¶ Probably corresponds to ancient Sumer and Babylonia, encompassing the southern portion of modern Iraq between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.",

It is listed along with other towns in the region, such as Shunem, Hapharaim, and Anaharath. The exact location of Shion is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the Jezreel Valley, within the territory of Issachar. Some scholars propose identifying Shion with Khirbet Sha'in, an archaeological site located approximately 4 miles northwest of Mount Tabor . However, this identification remains tentative due to limited archaeological evidence. The name \"Shion\" may be derived from the Hebrew verb \"shw',\" meaning \"to be emptied or ravaged\" , possibly indicating the town's history or condition. The mention of Shion in the allotment of Issachar's territory highlights the importance of the tribal inheritance and the distribution of towns and lands among the people of Israel.",

Among the nations mentioned are the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, and the people of Shoa. The exact identity and location of Shoa are uncertain, but it is likely that they were a people group from the region of Mesopotamia or the Arabian Peninsula. Some scholars propose that Shoa may be a reference to the Sutu, a nomadic people mentioned in Assyrian and Babylonian texts. The inclusion of Shoa in this list of nations highlights the extent of Jerusalem's spiritual unfaithfulness and its alliances with foreign powers. The prophecy warns of the judgment that will come upon Jerusalem for its sins, as God will bring these nations against the city to execute His punishment.",

This woman, recognizing Elisha as a holy man of God, prepared a room for him to stay whenever he passed through the town. In return for her kindness, Elisha prophesied that she would have a son, despite her husband's old age. Later, when the child died, Elisha raised him back to life, demonstrating God's power and the prophet's authority (2 Ki. 4:18-37). ¶Shunem is also mentioned in the context of the conflict between Israel and the Philistines during the reign of King Saul. The Philistines gathered their forces at Shunem, while Saul and the Israelites camped at Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. 28:4). It was during this time that Saul, in desperation, sought out a medium to consult the spirit of the deceased prophet Samuel (1 Sam. 28:7-25). ¶The town of Shunem was strategically located along the main trade route connecting the Jezreel Valley with the coastal plain. Its mention in various biblical narratives highlights its importance as a regional center and a place of significant events in Israel's history.

Later, Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur, sojourning in Gerar (Gen. 20:1). The descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son with Hagar, are described as dwelling from Havilah to Shur, east of Egypt (Gen. 25:18). ¶During the Exodus, after crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites went three days into the wilderness of Shur before reaching Marah, where God miraculously provided drinkable water (Exod. 15:22). In the time of King Saul, he defeated the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt (1 Sam. 15:7). Later, when David was fleeing from Saul, he and his men raided the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites, who inhabited the land from Telam as far as Shur and Egypt (1 Sam. 27:8). ¶The exact boundaries of the wilderness of Shur are not specified in the Bible, but it appears to have been a desert region stretching from the eastern border of Egypt toward Canaan. Its location along the route between these two regions made it a significant area for travel, trade, and military campaigns in biblical times.",

    "longDescription": "Sibmah, also known as Sebam (Num. 32:3), was a town located in the territory of Moab, east of the Jordan River. It was initially conquered by the Israelites during their journey to Canaan and allotted to the tribe of Reuben (Num. 32:38; Josh. 13:19). The town was known for its lush vineyards, which were celebrated for their productivity and the quality of their grapes. ¶The prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah both mention Sibmah in their prophecies concerning the judgment of Moab. Isaiah laments over the destruction of the vineyards of Sibmah, describing how the rulers of the nations have trampled down its vines that once reached as far as Jazer and the wilderness (Isa. 16:8-9). Similarly, Jeremiah prophesies that the shouting over the summer fruits and the harvest will cease in the fields of Heshbon and the vineyards of Sibmah (Jer. 48:32). ¶These prophecies indicate that Sibmah, along with other Moabite towns, would face divine judgment for its pride and idolatry. The destruction of its renowned vineyards symbolizes the extent of the coming devastation and the loss of Moab's prosperity and joy. ¶Although the exact location of Sibmah is uncertain, it is believed to have been situated near Heshbon, a prominent Moabite city. The ruins of Qurn el-Kibsh, about 3 miles southwest of Heshbon, have been proposed as a possible site for ancient Sibmah.",

In this vision, Ezekiel describes the northern border of the land, extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. Sibraim is listed as one of the landmarks along this border, situated between the territory of Damascus and that of Hamath. ¶The exact location of Sibraim is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. Some scholars propose that it may be identified with the modern-day village of Khirbet Sariman, located about 40 miles northeast of Damascus. However, this identification remains tentative due to the lack of conclusive evidence. ¶Ezekiel's vision of the restored Promised Land and its boundaries, including the mention of Sibraim, emphasizes God's faithfulness to His covenant promises and His plan to restore Israel to its rightful inheritance. The delineation of the land's borders also highlights the importance of God's sovereign allotment and the need for His people to trust in His provision and guidance.",

    "longDescription": "The Valley of Siddim, also known as the Valley of the Dead Sea (Gen. 14:3), was a low-lying area situated near the southern end of the Dead Sea. It is mentioned in the context of the battle between the four kings of the east, led by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and the five kings of the cities of the plain, including the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 14:8-10). ¶The Valley of Siddim is described as being full of tar pits (Gen. 14:10), which played a significant role in the battle's outcome. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of their men fell into these tar pits, while the rest escaped to the hills. This allowed the eastern kings to seize the goods and provisions of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as capture Lot, Abraham's nephew, who was living in Sodom (Gen. 14:11-12). ¶The exact location of the Valley of Siddim is uncertain, as the geography of the region has undergone significant changes since biblical times. Some scholars believe that it may have been located in the area now covered by the southern basin of the Dead Sea, which is much shallower than the northern basin. Others propose that it could have been situated in the nearby plain, south of the Dead Sea. ¶The mention of the Valley of Siddim in the Bible is significant, as it sets the stage for Abraham's rescue of Lot and his subsequent encounter with Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High (Gen. 14:13-20). This event demonstrates Abraham's faith, courage, and loyalty to his family, as well as his reverence for Melchizedek, a figure who foreshadows the priesthood of Christ (Heb. 7:1-10).",

It is mentioned in various contexts throughout the Bible, including the Old Testament (Gen. 10:19; Josh. 11:8; Judg. 10:6; Isa. 23:2-4; Jer. 27:3; Ezek. 28:21-22) and the New Testament (Matt. 11:21-22; Luke 4:26; Acts 27:3).",
    "longDescription": "Sidon was an ancient Phoenician city located on the Mediterranean coast. First mentioned in Genesis as a border marker of Canaan (Genesis 10:19), it was named among the territories that Israel failed to conquer (Judges 1:31). ¶ The city was known for its maritime expertise. Sidonians were skilled sailors and craftsmen, particularly noted for their lumber trade. They supplied cedar for both Solomon's temple and the post-exile reconstruction (1 Kings 5:6; Ezra 3:7). Ezekiel described Sidon's mariners as skilled oarsmen (Ezekiel 27:8). ¶ Sidon frequently appears in connection with idolatry. The city's deities, particularly Ashtoreth, influenced Israelite worship during periods of apostasy (Judges 10:6). Solomon's Sidonian wives led him into idol worship (1 Kings 11:1,5), and Jezebel, a Sidonian princess, promoted Baal worship in Israel (1 Kings 16:31). ¶ Several prophets pronounced judgment against Sidon. Isaiah depicted it as a mourning merchant city (Isaiah 23:2,4,12). Jeremiah included it among nations to drink God's cup of wrath (Jeremiah 25:22). Ezekiel prophesied against it, declaring God would be glorified through its judgment (Ezekiel 28:21-22). ¶ In the New Testament, Jesus mentioned Sidon in comparing it favorably to unrepentant Jewish cities (Matthew 11:21-22). He visited the region of Tyre and Sidon (Mark 7:24,31), and people from these areas came to hear him (Luke 6:17). The apostle Paul visited Sidon during his journey to Rome (Acts 27:3). ¶ The city maintained commercial relations with Herod's territories, as evidenced by the reference to Tyre and Sidon's dependence on Herod's country for food (Acts 12:20). ¶ Probably corresponds to modern Saida in Lebanon, which has maintained continuous habitation since ancient times.",

Joash, who had been hiding in the Temple of the Lord, was killed by his servants at the house of Millo, on the way down to Silla. The exact location of Silla is unknown, but it was likely a place in or near Jerusalem, possibly a road or a district in the city. Some scholars propose that Silla may be related to the Hebrew word \"mesillah,\" meaning \"highway\" or \"causeway,\" suggesting that it could have been a major thoroughfare. The assassination of Joash at Silla marked the end of his reign and the beginning of the reign of his son Amaziah (2 Ki. 12:21). This event highlights the political instability and violence that often characterized the monarchy in Judah and Israel.",

The people had been grumbling against Moses and Aaron due to the lack of food, and God responded by miraculously supplying them with sustenance. The manna, described as a fine, flake-like substance, appeared every morning except on the Sabbath, and the Israelites were instructed to gather only as much as they needed for each day. ¶The Israelites left the Wilderness of Sin and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink (Exod. 17:1). Once again, the people complained against Moses, and God instructed him to strike the rock at Horeb, which miraculously provided water for the entire congregation (Exod. 17:5-7). ¶In the list of the Israelites' campsites recorded in the Book of Numbers, the Wilderness of Sin is mentioned between the campsites of Dophkah and Alush (Num. 33:11-12). ¶The experiences of the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sin, including the provision of manna and water, served as important lessons about God's faithfulness, providence, and the importance of trusting in Him. These events also foreshadowed the spiritual sustenance that God would provide through Jesus Christ, the true bread from heaven (John 6:31-35).",

    "longDescription": "Sinai, also known as Mount Sinai, Horeb, or Mount Horeb, is one of the most significant locations in the Bible. It is the mountain where God revealed Himself to Moses and gave him the Ten Commandments, as well as other laws and instructions for the Israelites. ¶After the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites camped at the base of Mount Sinai for about a year (Exod. 19:1-2). During this time, God called Moses to the top of the mountain and spoke to him, giving him the Ten Commandments and other laws (Exod. 19-31). The mountain was filled with smoke, fire, and thunder, symbolizing the awesome presence of God (Exod. 19:16-19). ¶Moses spent forty days and forty nights on the mountain, receiving instructions from God and writing down the laws (Exod. 24:18; 34:28). He also received the two stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments (Exod. 31:18; 34:1, 4, 28-29). ¶The location of Mount Sinai is not specified in the Bible, but tradition has identified it with Jebel Musa (Mountain of Moses) in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula. However, some scholars have proposed alternative locations, such as Jebel al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia, based on various geographical and archaeological considerations. ¶Throughout the Bible, Sinai is mentioned as a symbol of God's revelation, covenant, and law (Deut. 33:2; Judg. 5:5; Ps. 68:8, 17; Neh. 9:13; Mal. 4:4). In the New Testament, Paul uses Sinai as an allegory for the old covenant, in contrast to the new covenant represented by the heavenly Jerusalem (Gal. 4:24-25). ¶The events at Sinai, including the giving of the Ten Commandments and the establishment of the Mosaic covenant, were pivotal moments in the history of Israel and laid the foundation for their identity as God's chosen people.",

The Israelites set up the Tabernacle in the Sinai Wilderness (Numbers 1:1,19; 9:1,5). They took a census of the people there (Numbers 1:19, 26:64). The Sinai Wilderness was one of the early stops on Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land (Numbers 10:12, 33:15-16). The wilderness provided a place of testing and preparation for the nation before they entered Canaan. The Sinai Wilderness is synonymous with the region surrounding Mount Sinai, the place of God's revelation to Moses and Israel.",

The exact location of Siphmoth is unknown, but it was probably situated in the southern part of Judah, near other towns mentioned in the same passage, such as Aroer, Eshtemoa, and Hormah.

Joab, David's military commander, held a grudge against Abner for killing his brother Asahel in battle (2 Sam. 2:18-23). ¶When Abner left David's presence at Hebron, Joab sent messengers after him and brought him back from the Cistern of Sirah. Upon Abner's return, Joab took him aside and stabbed him to death in revenge for his brother's killing (2 Sam. 3:27). ¶The exact location of Sirah is not specified in the biblical text, but it was apparently a well-known landmark near Hebron. The name \"Sirah\" may be derived from the Hebrew word \"sur,\" meaning \"to turn aside\" or \"to depart,\" possibly indicating a place where travelers would stop or turn off the main road. ¶David, who had not authorized Abner's murder, mourned his death and publicly cursed Joab and his family for their treachery (2 Sam. 3:28-39).

He also dug new wells, including one he named Sitnah. ¶The name \"Sitnah\" is derived from the Hebrew word \"satan,\" meaning \"accusation\" or \"enmity.\" This name was given to the well because the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, claiming the water as their own. ¶The dispute over the well at Sitnah was part of a larger pattern of conflict between Isaac and the Philistines. The Philistines, envious of Isaac's prosperity, had stopped up the wells and sent him away (Gen. 26:14-16). Despite these challenges, Isaac persisted in his efforts to establish himself in the land, trusting in God's promise to bless him and his descendants. ¶The story of Isaac's wells, including Sitnah, illustrates the challenges faced by the patriarchs as they sought to maintain their presence in Canaan. It also highlights the importance of water rights in the semi-arid region and the potential for conflict over these valuable resources.",

Jesus encourages them not to fear the impending persecution, which would include imprisonment and testing for \"ten days\" (Rev. 2:10). This may refer to a specific period of intense persecution or symbolize a limited time of trial. ¶Christ exhorts the church to remain faithful even unto death, promising them the \"crown of life\" as a reward for their steadfast endurance (Rev. 2:10). He also assures them that those who overcome will not be harmed by the \"second death,\" which is eternal separation from God (Rev. 2:11). ¶Smyrna was known for its beauty, commerce, and loyalty to Rome. It had a large Jewish population, which may have contributed to the persecution faced by the early Christian church there. The city was also a center of emperor worship, which likely created additional pressure for Christians who refused to participate in these pagan rituals. ¶The message to the church of Smyrna serves as an encouragement to all believers who face persecution and hardship for their faith. It reminds them that their ultimate loyalty is to Christ and that eternal life awaits those who remain faithful to Him.",

It was in this valley that David, armed only with a sling and five smooth stones, defeated the giant Goliath, leading to a great victory for Israel (1 Sam. 17:40-54). ¶During the reign of King Solomon, Socoh was included in the district overseen by Ben-hesed, one of the twelve officers responsible for providing food for the king and his household (1 Ki. 4:10). ¶Later, when Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became king, he fortified Socoh as part of his efforts to strengthen the defenses of Judah (2 Chr. 11:7). However, during the reign of King Ahaz, Socoh was among the towns captured by the Philistines (2 Chr. 28:18). ¶The exact location of Socoh is uncertain, but it is believed to be either Khirbet Abbad or Khirbet Shuweikeh, both located in the Shephelah region.",

However, in later years, Syrian kings often posed a threat to Israel and Judah, forming alliances against them (1 Kgs. 15:18-20; 2 Kgs. 16:5-9). The Arameans, the inhabitants of Syria, are mentioned as worshipping foreign gods (Judg. 10:6). In the New Testament, Syria is mentioned in connection with the spread of the gospel and the early church (Acts 15:23, 41; Gal. 1:21). The apostle Paul spent time in Syria during his missionary journeys (Acts 18:18; 21:3). A Syrophoenician woman is mentioned in Mark 7:26, highlighting Jesus' ministry in the region. Syria played a significant role in the history of Israel and the early church.",

The city is mentioned in the song of Deborah as the site of a battle against the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera (Judg. 5:19). It was also included in the administrative district overseen by Baana, one of Solomon's twelve officers (1 Kgs. 4:12).

Mount Tabor is also mentioned as a boundary marker for the tribe of Zebulun (Josh. 19:22) and is praised for its beauty along with Mount Hermon in Psalm 89:12.

    "longDescription": "Tahpanhes (also known as Tehaphnehes or Tahapanes) was an important Egyptian city mentioned by the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel. It was located in Lower Egypt, near the eastern border. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, Jewish refugees, including the prophet Jeremiah, fled to Tahpanhes (Jer. 43:7). Jeremiah prophesied that Nebuchadnezzar would invade Egypt and bring destruction upon Tahpanhes and other Egyptian cities where the Jewish refugees had settled (Jer. 46:14). Ezekiel also foretold the destruction of Tahpanhes when Nebuchadnezzar would strike Egypt (Ezek. 30:18). The city was known for its large foreign population, including a garrison of Greek mercenaries established by Pharaoh Psammetichus I. Tahpanhes is also mentioned as a witness to the desolation of the cities of Judah (Jer. 44:1). The name \"Tahpanhes\" is of Egyptian origin and may mean \"Fortress of the Nubian\" or \"Fortress of Pinehas.\"",

The \"ships of Tarshish\" became a symbol of wealth and commercial power (Isa. 2:16; 23:1, 14; 60:9; Ezek. 27:25). Tarshish was a source of silver, iron, tin, and lead (Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:12). It was also associated with other distant and exotic locations, such as Sheba and Seba (Ps. 72:10). The exact location of Tarshish is uncertain, but many scholars believe it was situated in southern Spain, possibly near the ancient Phoenician colony of Tartessus. In the book of Jonah, the prophet attempts to flee from God's presence by sailing to Tarshish, emphasizing its distance from Israel (Jonah 1:3). The wealth and splendor of Tarshish are used as a metaphor for God's judgment (Isa. 23:6, 10; Ezek. 38:13). Despite its prominence, Tarshish would ultimately be subject to God's sovereignty (Ps. 48:7).",

Paul described himself as \"a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city\" (Acts 21:39), indicating Tarsus' significance and his own status as a citizen. After his conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul spent time in Tarsus (Acts 9:30) before being brought to Antioch by Barnabas (Acts 11:25). Tarsus was a center of Greek culture and learning, with a renowned university. It was also an important commercial hub, situated on major trade routes. The city's strategic location and cultural influence shaped Paul's background and prepared him for his future ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.",

Tekoa was also the hometown of the wise woman who, at Joab's request, persuaded David to reconcile with his son Absalom (2 Sam. 14:2-9). During the reign of Rehoboam, Tekoa was fortified as part of Judah's defense system (2 Chr. 11:6). The town was the birthplace of the prophet Amos, who identified himself as \"one of the shepherds of Tekoa\" (Amos 1:1). Amos's rural background and proximity to the wilderness shaped his prophetic message. In the time of Jehoshaphat, the people of Judah gathered in the wilderness of Tekoa to seek God's help against their enemies (2 Chr. 20:20). The town was also involved in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls during the time of Nehemiah (Neh. 3:5, 27). Jeremiah mentioned Tekoa in his prophecy, urging the people to flee and sound the trumpet of warning (Jer. 6:1).",

The exact location of Telaim is uncertain, but it was likely situated in the southern part of Judah, near the region inhabited by the Amalekites. After gathering his forces at Telaim, Saul proceeded to attack and defeat the Amalekites, but he disobeyed God's command by sparing their king, Agag, and some of the best livestock. This act of disobedience led to God's rejection of Saul as king (1 Sam. 15:10-23).",

Jeremiah 25:23 lists Tema among the Arabian tribes and kingdoms that would face God's judgment and be made to drink the cup of His wrath. The exact location of Tema is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, along the trade routes connecting Arabia with Mesopotamia and the Levant. The Tema oasis was a significant stopover for caravans, providing water and provisions for travelers. The tribe of Tema was likely involved in facilitating trade and offering protection to merchant caravans passing through their territory.

Ezekiel foretold the destruction of Thebes, stating that God would execute judgments against the city (Ezek. 30:14-16). Nahum used Thebes as an example of a mighty city that fell despite its strength and allies, comparing it to Nineveh (Nah. 3:8-10).

Abimelech then asked his armor-bearer to kill him with a sword, so that it would not be said that a woman had killed him. The incident at Thebez is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 11:21, when Joab rebuked David's messenger for getting too close to the wall during the siege of Rabbah, reminding him of Abimelech's fate at Thebez.

The apostle Paul visited Thessalonica during his second missionary journey, accompanied by Silas and Timothy (Acts 17:1-9). Paul preached in the synagogue for three Sabbaths, reasoning from the Scriptures about Jesus as the Messiah. Some Jews and a large number of God-fearing Greeks, including prominent women, believed and joined Paul and Silas. However, jealous Jews formed a mob and caused an uproar in the city, accusing Paul and Silas of defying Caesar's decrees. The believers sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. Despite the opposition, a strong church was established in Thessalonica. Paul later wrote two epistles to the Thessalonian church, addressing their concerns and encouraging them in their faith (1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1). Thessalonica is also mentioned in connection with Paul's travels and ministry (Acts 20:4; 27:2; Phil. 4:16; 2 Tim. 4:10).",

The name \"Three Taverns\" suggests that it served as a rest stop and a place of lodging for travelers. When the apostle Paul was being escorted to Rome as a prisoner, some Christians from Rome journeyed to meet him at Three Taverns and the Forum of Appius (Acts 28:15). This gesture of support and fellowship likely encouraged Paul as he faced an uncertain future in the imperial capital. The fact that the Roman Christians were willing to travel a considerable distance to meet Paul testifies to his reputation and the esteem in which he was held by the early church.",

She encountered the apostle Paul in Philippi and became a convert to Christianity (Acts 16:14-15). Thyatira is also mentioned as one of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 1:11). In the letter to the church in Thyatira, the risen Christ commends the believers for their love, faith, service, and patient endurance (Rev. 2:18-19). However, he also rebukes them for tolerating a false prophetess, symbolically referred to as \"Jezebel,\" who promoted sexual immorality and idolatry (Rev. 2:20-23).

Daniel, who had been exiled to Babylon, was standing on the bank of the Tigris when he saw a man dressed in linen and heard a message concerning future events. The Tigris River originates in the mountains of eastern Turkey and flows through Iraq before joining the Euphrates to form the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf.

    "longDescription": "Timnah was a Canaanite city located on the border between the territories of Judah and Dan. It is first mentioned in the story of Judah and Tamar, where Judah's son Er was married to Tamar (Gen. 38:12-14). Later, during the conquest of Canaan, Timnah was allocated to the tribe of Dan (Josh. 19:43) but was also mentioned as part of Judah's territory (Josh. 15:10). In the time of the judges, Samson went down to Timnah and fell in love with a Philistine woman, whom he desired to marry (Judg. 14:1-5). The city was later captured by the Philistines during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah (2 Chr. 28:18). Timnah was situated in the Sorek Valley, known for its fertile land and strategic location on trade routes. ¶The Timnites are mentioned in Judges 15:6 as the people of the Philistine city of Timnah. Samson, one of the judges of Israel, had married a Philistine woman from Timnah. However, during the wedding feast, Samson posed a riddle to the Philistine guests, which they could not solve. They threatened Samson's wife to reveal the answer, which she did. In anger, Samson killed thirty Philistine men and left his wife. Later, when Samson attempted to visit his wife, he discovered that her father had given her to another man. In revenge, Samson burned the Philistines' fields, vineyards, and olive groves. The Timnites retaliated by burning Samson's wife and her father to death. This escalated the conflict between Samson and the Philistines.",

When the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead sought out Jephthah in the land of Tob and requested that he lead them in battle (Judg. 11:5-6). Jephthah agreed and successfully defeated the Ammonites. The region of Tob is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 10:6, 8, where the Ammonites hired mercenaries from Tob to fight against King David's army.

The name \"Topheth\" is believed to derive from the Hebrew word for \"fireplace\" or \"hearth,\" indicating its association with burning. The Valley of Hinnom was used as a burial ground (Jer 19:11) and a place of idolatrous worship, where people burned their children as offerings to the Canaanite god Molech (2 Chr 28:3; 33:6). King Josiah defiled Topheth to put an end to these practices (2 Kgs 23:10). The valley became a symbol of divine judgment and a metaphor for hell (Isa 30:33). In the New Testament, the Greek word \"Gehenna,\" derived from \"Valley of Hinnom,\" is used to refer to the place of eternal punishment (Matt 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5; Jas 3:6).",

The tower was likely a watchtower used by shepherds to guard their flocks near Bethlehem. In Micah 4:8, the prophet addresses the Tower of the Flock, associating it with the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of the kingdom to Jerusalem. This passage has led some interpreters to view the Tower of Eder as a prophetic symbol of the birthplace of the Messiah, linking it to the fields near Bethlehem where the shepherds received the announcement of Jesus' birth (Luke 2:8-20). However, the exact location of the tower and its significance in Messianic prophecy remain a matter of interpretation.",

The prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah also mention the Tower of Hananel in their visions of Jerusalem's future restoration and expansion (Jer. 31:38; Zech. 14:10). In these prophetic passages, the tower serves as a boundary marker, indicating the extent of the city's rebuilding and the scope of God's blessing upon Jerusalem.

The region was known for its caves, which were often used as hideouts by robbers. Herod the Great had previously routed out these robbers to maintain order in the area. After Philip's death, Trachonitis was briefly annexed to the province of Syria before being given to Agrippa I by Caligula. The exact boundaries of Trachonitis are not clearly defined in the Bible, but it is generally associated with the modern-day Leja' region in southern Syria.",

The burial of Gog's army will be so extensive that it will block the path of travelers passing through the valley, hence its name. The exact location of this valley is not specified, but it is described as being east of the sea, likely referring to the Dead Sea. The burial of Gog's army in the Valley of the Travelers serves as a symbol of God's judgment against those who oppose Him and His people, and it will take seven months for the Israelites to cleanse the land by burying the dead (Ezek. 39:12-16).",

During his second missionary journey, Paul received a vision of a man from Macedonia pleading with him to come and help them while he was in Troas (Acts 16:8-10). This vision prompted Paul and his companions to sail from Troas to Macedonia, marking a significant expansion of the gospel into Europe. Later, during his third missionary journey, Paul spent a week in Troas, where he preached late into the night (Acts 20:5-12). During this visit, a young man named Eutychus fell asleep and fell from a window, but Paul raised him back to life. Paul also visited Troas on other occasions (2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13), indicating the city's importance as a strategic location for his ministry.",

The exact location of Tubal is uncertain, but it is generally associated with the region of eastern Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and the southern Caucasus. Some scholars identify Tubal with the Tabali, a people group mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions.

    "longDescription": "Tyre was a major Phoenician port city located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its wealth, trade, and skilled craftsmen. The city is first mentioned in the Bible as part of the boundary of the tribe of Asher (Josh. 19:29). Tyre's king, Hiram, provided cedar, cypress timber, and skilled workers to David for his palace (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1) and to Solomon for the construction of the Temple (1 Kgs. 5:1; 9:11-12; 2 Chr. 2:3-16). Despite this friendly relationship, Tyre is often denounced by the prophets for its pride, idolatry, and oppression of God's people (Isa. 23; Jer. 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezek. 26-28; Amos 1:9-10). Ezekiel prophesied the destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar (Ezek. 26) and its eventual restoration and dedication of its wealth to God (Isa. 23:17-18). In the New Testament, Jesus visited the region of Tyre and Sidon and performed miracles there (Matt. 15:21; Mark 7:24-31). He also used Tyre and Sidon as examples of cities that would have repented if they had witnessed the miracles performed in Chorazin and Bethsaida (Matt. 11:21-22; Luke 10:13-14). The apostle Paul visited Tyre during his missionary journeys (Acts 21:3-7). Throughout the Bible, Tyre is portrayed as a symbol of wealth, trade, and worldly influence, often contrasted with the values of God's kingdom.",

In Daniel's vision, he finds himself beside the Ulai Canal, where he sees a ram with two horns standing beside the river (Dan. 8:3). The ram is later interpreted as representing the kings of Media and Persia (Dan. 8:20). As the vision continues, Daniel sees a male goat coming from the west, which defeats the ram (Dan. 8:5-7). The goat is interpreted as the king of Greece (Dan. 8:21). The Ulai River is mentioned again when the angel Gabriel approaches Daniel to explain the vision (Dan. 8:16). The river's location in Elam, combined with the mention of Susa, suggests that the Ulai may be associated with the ancient city of Susa, which served as one of the capitals of the Persian Empire. The Ulai River is thus connected with important prophetic visions in the Book of Daniel, which foretell the rise and fall of major world empires and their impact on God's people.",

In Daniel 10:5, the prophet Daniel has a vision of a man clothed in linen, whose waist was girded with gold from Uphaz. The use of gold from Uphaz in both passages suggests that it was highly valued and associated with wealth and luxury. The exact location of Uphaz is uncertain, and some scholars believe it may be a variant spelling or a copyist's error for Ophir, another region famous for its gold in the Bible (1 Kgs. 9:28; 10:11; 22:48; 1 Chr. 29:4; 2 Chr. 8:18; 9:10; Job 22:24; 28:16; Ps. 45:9; Isa. 13:12). However, others maintain that Uphaz was a distinct place, possibly located in the Arabian Peninsula or the Near East, known for its high-quality gold. Regardless of its exact location, the mention of Uphaz in the Bible underscores the importance and value placed on gold in ancient Near Eastern cultures.",

It is best known as the hometown of Abraham, the patriarch of the Israelites. According to Genesis, Abraham (then called Abram) lived in Ur with his father Terah, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot (Gen. 11:28-31). God called Abraham to leave Ur and go to the land of Canaan, promising to make him a great nation and a blessing to all the families of the earth (Gen. 12:1-3). Abraham obeyed and set out from Ur, traveling first to Haran and then to Canaan (Gen. 11:31; 12:4-5). Later, when God confirms His covenant with Abraham, He reminds him that He brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give him the land of Canaan (Gen. 15:7). The city of Ur is also mentioned in Nehemiah 9:7, where the Levites recount God's faithfulness in bringing Abraham out of Ur and making a covenant with him. Archaeologists have identified the ancient city of Ur with modern-day Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq, which was once a thriving center of Sumerian civilization. The biblical account of Abraham's origins in Ur highlights God's sovereign plan in calling and guiding His chosen people from the very beginning.",

The people of Uz are referred to as \"the people of the East\" (Job 1:3), and the land was vulnerable to Chaldean raiding parties (Job 1:17). Uz is also mentioned in Jeremiah 25:20 among the nations that will drink the cup of God's wrath, and in Lamentations 4:21, where Edom is addressed as dwelling in the land of Uz.

The exact location of Uzal is uncertain, but some scholars believe it may refer to a region in Arabia, possibly associated with the ancient city of Sanaa in modern-day Yemen. Other interpretations suggest that Uzal could be a reference to a type of high-quality sword or blade, rather than a geographical location. The mention of Uzal in Ezekiel's prophecy highlights the extensive trade network of Tyre and the various commodities exchanged in the ancient Near East.",

Upon his return to Jerusalem, he attempted to undo some of the damage caused by his earlier actions (2 Chr. 33:14-16). After Manasseh's death, he was buried in his own house, in the garden of Uzza (2 Kgs. 21:18). Amon, Manasseh's son, succeeded him as king but continued in the evil ways of his father's earlier reign. After ruling for only two years, Amon was assassinated by his servants and was also buried in the garden of Uzza (2 Kgs. 21:19-26).

The exact location of Uzzen-sheerah is not specified in the Bible, but it was probably situated in the territory allocated to the tribe of Ephraim, in the central region of Canaan. The mention of Sheerah as the builder of these towns is notable, as it is unusual for women to be credited with such accomplishments in the biblical record.

The Valley Gate is also prominently mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which describes the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls after the Babylonian exile. Nehemiah inspected the Valley Gate during his nighttime survey of the city's damaged walls (Neh. 2:13, 15). Later, during the rebuilding process, Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate, including its doors, bolts, and bars (Neh. 3:13). The exact location of the Valley Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the western side of Jerusalem, leading to the Hinnom Valley.

They stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway to the Washer's Field, and called for the king. The Washer's Field was likely an area outside the city walls where launderers washed and dried clothes, taking advantage of the water supply from the nearby pool. The prophet Isaiah also mentions the Washer's Field in an earlier prophecy (Isa. 7:3), where God instructs him to meet King Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the Washer's Field, to deliver a message of reassurance concerning the impending Assyrian threat.

Later, when Ezra the scribe read the Book of the Law to the people, he did so in the square before the Water Gate (Neh. 8:1, 3). The people listened attentively and responded with worship and repentance. During the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles, the people gathered at the Water Gate to hear the Law read and to celebrate the feast (Neh. 8:16). The Water Gate is also mentioned in the description of the dedication of the rebuilt wall, where two choirs proceeded along the wall in opposite directions, with one group going past the Water Gate (Neh. 12:37). The exact location of the Water Gate is not specified in the Bible, but it was likely situated on the eastern side of Jerusalem, near the Gihon Spring, which provided a vital water source for the city. The Water Gate's association with the reading of the Law and the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles emphasizes its importance as a place of spiritual renewal and community gathering in post-exilic Jerusalem.",

It is a path that leads to Zion, symbolizing the journey of God's people to His presence and blessing. The Way of Holiness is part of a broader prophetic vision in Isaiah 35, which describes the restoration and transformation of creation, the healing of the blind, deaf, lame, and mute, and the joy of the redeemed as they return to Zion (Isa. 35:1-10). This vision points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of His kingdom, where holiness and righteousness will prevail.

Saul, having returned from pursuing the Philistines, took 3,000 chosen men to search for David and his men in the Wildgoats Rocks region. While Saul was in a cave relieving himself, David had the opportunity to cut off a corner of the king's robe, demonstrating his loyalty and respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed. The rugged terrain of Wildgoats Rocks provided numerous hiding places for David and his men, making it difficult for Saul to locate them. The name \"Wildgoats Rocks\" likely refers to the rugged, steep cliffs in the area, which are suitable habitats for wild goats. This incident in the Wildgoats Rocks demonstrates David's integrity and faith in God's plan for his life, as he refused to harm Saul, even when presented with the opportunity.",

The name \"Yeshanah\" means \"old\" in Hebrew, suggesting that this gate may have been one of the older entrances to the city or that it led to an older part of Jerusalem.

The name \"Zaanan\" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning \"to go out\" or \"to come forth,\" which may be a wordplay on the town's failure to come to the aid of its neighbors during a time of crisis.

    "longDescription": "Zaanannim is a place mentioned twice in the Bible, once in Joshua 19:33 and again in Judges 4:11. In Joshua 19:33, Zaanannim is described as being near Kedesh, a city in the territory of Naphtali, in the northern part of Canaan. The verse mentions Zaanannim as part of the boundary description for the allotment of land to the tribe of Naphtali. In Judges 4:11, Zaanannim is associated with the Kenites, a nomadic tribe that was friendly to the Israelites. The verse states that Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanannim. This reference to Zaanannim occurs in the context of the story of Deborah and Barak, who led the Israelites in a battle against Sisera, the commander of King Jabin's army. Heber's wife, Jael, would later kill Sisera by driving a tent peg through his temple as he slept (Judg. 4:17-22). The exact location of Zaanannim is not certain, but its association with Kedesh and the Kenites suggests that it was situated in the northern region of Israel, near the border with Syria.",

In Psalm 48:2, Mount Zion is described as being \"in the far north,\" using the term \"Zaphon\" to emphasize its sacred status. In Isaiah 14:13, the king of Babylon is portrayed as aspiring to ascend to heaven and sit on the mount of assembly \"in the far reaches of the north\" (Zaphon), symbolizing his desire to usurp God's authority. The term \"Zaphon\" is also mentioned in Judges 12:1, where the Ephraimites gathered in Zaphon before confronting Jephthah.

Upon arriving at the city gate, Elijah met the widow and asked her for water and bread. Despite her limited resources, the widow shared her last meal with Elijah, and as a result, her flour and oil miraculously never ran out until the end of the famine (1 Kgs. 17:10-16). Later, when the widow's son fell ill and died, Elijah prayed to God and raised the boy back to life (1 Kgs. 17:17-24). In the New Testament, Jesus references Elijah's stay in Zarephath as an example of God's grace extending beyond Israel to the Gentiles (Luke 4:26). The city is also mentioned in the Book of Obadiah, where it is prophesied that the exiles of Israel will possess the land as far as Zarephath (Obad. 1:20). Zarephath's significance in the Bible lies in its connection to Elijah's ministry and its role in demonstrating God's power and provision.",

It is first mentioned in Joshua 3:16 as a location near Adam where the waters of the Jordan River were cut off, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. Later, in the account of Gideon's pursuit of the Midianites, Zarethan is mentioned as a point of reference (Judg. 7:22). During the reign of Solomon, Zarethan is noted as the place where Hiram, a Phoenician craftsman, cast bronze implements for the Temple in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan (1 Kgs. 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17). The city is also mentioned in 1 Kings 4:12 to help locate Beth-Shean, which was in Solomon's fifth administrative district. Although the exact location of Zarethan is uncertain, it is believed to have been situated in the Jordan Valley, possibly on the west bank of the river. Some scholars propose identifying it with Tell el-Mazar (also known as Qerawa or Korea) near Mount Sartabe, while others suggest it may have been on the east bank. Regardless of its precise location, Zarethan played a role in significant events in Israel's history, from the miraculous crossing of the Jordan to the construction of Solomon's Temple.",

In Genesis 14, Zeboiim is listed among the cities that rebelled against Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and his allies after serving them for twelve years. The king of Zeboiim, along with the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Bela (Zoar), engaged in battle against Chedorlaomer and his allies in the Valley of Siddim but were defeated (Gen. 14:2, 8-10). Later, when God determined to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Zeboiim was also included in the destruction (Deut. 29:23). The prophet Hosea, in a message of judgment against Israel, refers to Zeboiim along with Admah as examples of God's punishment, emphasizing the severity of Israel's impending judgment (Hos. 11:8). The destruction of Zeboiim, along with the other cities of the plain, serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent wickedness and disobedience to God.",

In Ezekiel's vision of the restored land of Israel (Ezek. 47:15), Zedad is again mentioned as part of the northern border, along with the entrance of Hamath and Berothah. The exact location of Zedad is uncertain, but it is believed to have been situated in the region of Hamath, north of Damascus in modern-day Syria. Its mention in both the Mosaic and Ezekiel's descriptions of the land's boundaries highlights its significance as a geographical marker and its role in defining the extent of the Promised Land.

God granted their request, and the Israelites \"utterly destroyed\" the Canaanites and named the place Hormah, meaning \"destruction\" (Num.21:1-3). ¶However, Israel later refused to enter Canaan from Kadesh Barnea out of unbelief. When they then presumptuously tried to go up, the Amalekites and Canaanites defeated them as far as Hormah (Num.14:45; Dt.1:44). Much later, after Joshua's conquests, Judah and Simeon fought against Zephath, defeated it, and renamed it Hormah (Jdg.1:17). The city is subsequently listed among the towns in the Negev allotted to Judah and Simeon (Jos.15:30; 19:4; 1Ch.4:30). David later sent some of the spoils from his victory over the Amalekites to his friends in Hormah (1Sa.30:30). The exact location is uncertain but it was likely somewhere south of the Dead Sea.",

King Solomon noticed Jeroboam's abilities and made him the overseer of the forced labor of the house of Joseph. However, the prophet Ahijah prophesied that God would tear the kingdom from Solomon's son and give ten tribes to Jeroboam. When Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, he fled to Egypt until Solomon's death. Zeredah's exact location is unknown but was likely in the hill country of Ephraim.",

While David and his men were away, the Amalekites attacked and burned Ziklag, taking captive the women and children (1Sa.30:1-2). David pursued them, defeated them, and recovered all that was taken (1Sa.30:18-20). David sent some of the spoils from this victory to his friends in Judah (1Sa.30:26). After Saul's death, David departed from Ziklag to go to Hebron (2Sa.1:1). During David's reign, some Benjamites and Manassites defected to him at Ziklag (1Ch.12:1,20).

Later, Moses and Aaron rebelled against God's command to speak to the rock to bring forth water, instead striking it twice (Num.27:14). As a result, they were not allowed to enter the Promised Land. The Wilderness of Zin formed part of the southern border of the land allotted to Judah (Jos.15:1,3). It marked the extreme southern limit of the Promised Land (Num.34:3-4). The Wilderness of Zin is also associated with Kadesh (Num.33:36), a significant site during Israel's wilderness journey.

    "longDescription": "Zobah, also referred to as Zobah-Hamath or Hamath-zobah, was an Aramean kingdom located northeast of Israel, in the region of modern-day Syria. During the reigns of Saul and David, the kings of Zobah were enemies of Israel (1Sa.14:47; 2Sa.8:3). David defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah, and his Aramean allies (2Sa.8:5,12; 10:6,8; 1Ch.18:5,9; 19:6). One of David's mighty men, Igal, was from Zobah (2Sa.23:36). During Solomon's reign, Rezon of Zobah established himself as king in Damascus and became an adversary to Israel (1Ki.11:23). Solomon later conquered Hamath-zobah (2Ch.8:3). The exact extent and location of Zobah are uncertain, but it was likely situated in the region between Hamath and Damascus, possibly centered around the modern-day city of Homs in Syria.",
